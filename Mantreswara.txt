MANTRESWARA'S

PHALA DEEPIKA

English Translation, Commentary

and annotation by Dr. G. S. Kapoor



Preface

Shri  Mantreswara's  'Phaladeeplka'  holds  a  most  distinguished  position 

amongst  the  great  ancient  astrological  classics  alongwith  Brihat  Parasara  Hora 

Sastra, Varahmihira's Brihat Jataka and Vaidya Natha's Jataka Parijata. It deals in a 

most  comprehensive  and  authoritative  manner  with  almost  all  the  astrological 

aspects of human life. There can be said to be nothing that this great work has 

omitted from its purview.

Some of the important subjects dealt with in a lucid manner in the book are: 

description  and characteristic  features  of  the  various  signs,  planets  and bhavas 

(houses), the various kinds of strengths of planets and their awasthas with their 

effects, sources of livelihood, yogas or planetary combinations leading to affluence 

and poverty, effects of planets in different houses, effects of different Ascendants, 

Female horoscopy, matters relating to matrimony and progeny determination of 

longevity,  judgment  of  houses,  various  kinds  of  Dasas  and  their  effects, 

Ashtakavarga and its  importance in the judging of  effects  of transit  of  planets, 

transit  effects  of  planets  and  constellations,  and  description  and  influence  of 

upagrahas.

The author of this book Shri Mantreswara is believed to have lived in the 

13th century when this valuable work must have been compiled. It is said that he 

belonged to a family of Namboodari  Brahmins and he was born in tirinevelley 

District of the erstwhile Madras Presidency (now known as Tamil Nadu). He was a 

devotee  of  Sukuntlambki  Devi.  As  a  young  man  his  name  was  Markandeya 

Bhattadri. To attain knowledge he is said to have travelled to far off places like 

Badrika Ashram in Himalayas and Mithila Pradesh - By sheer dint of hard work 

and  devotion,  he  became  well  versed  in  the  Vedanta  philosophy  and  in  the 

knowledge  of  other  sastras,  and  by  severe  observance  of  fast,  penance  and 

meditation,  he became gifted with divine knowledge and assumed the name of 

Mantreswara. His knowledge of Astrology was profound and the reference in his 

book to Parasara, Varahamihira and other learned astrologers indicates that he had 

2



made a deep study of all the ancient astrological works existing in his time.

The  present  book  is  so  instructive  that  beginners  as  well  as  advanced 

students of Astrology can obtain very useful guidance from its study.

"PHALA DEEPIKA"

Chapter 1

Information and characteristic features

of the Signs (Rasis) and the houses (Bhavas)

1. May the Supreme Divine Light (the Sun) who once above the horizon 

remains on end in view for six months (solar) to the pole dwelling Celestials, for 

half a month (Lunar) to the Moon dwelling manes and for 12 hours (entire day 

time) to the earth dwelling mortals and some times changes his direction to the 

north  (Uttarayan)  and  some-times  to  the  south  (Dakshinayan),  bless  us  with 

unlimited prosperity, good luck, splendor and beatitude.

2.  I,  the  astrologer  Mantreswara,  first  offer  my  respectful  obeisance  to 

Saraswati,  the  Goddess  of  speech  and  learning,  to  my  family  deity,  to  my 

preceptors, to the nine planets (the Sun, the Moon, Mars, Mercury, Jupiter, Venus, 

Saturn, Rahu and Ketu) to Lord Ganesha and Lord Shiva who bestow knowledge 

of the past, present and. future, and then give here for the benefit of astrologers a 

lucid version in a simple manner of the teachings of sages Atri and Parasara.

3. The first thing is to ascertain the exact time of birth of the native minutely 

in Ghatikas, Vighatikas etc., on the basis of tool measurement or by the gnomonic 

shadow and other apparatus. Then the positions of the planets (longitude) in Rasi 

(sign), amsa (degrees), Kala (minutes), and Vikala should be worked out by actual 

observation and mathematical  instruments.  The assessment of results should be 

made  thereafter  by  taking  into  account  the  longitudes  of  the  various  houses 

(Bhavaspast) and the strength of the houses and the planets.

4. Assuming that the horoscope represents the Kalapurusha, then the parts of 

the body beginning with the Ascendant (Lagna) will be as under:

First house (Lagna-Ascendant) — the head

Second house — the face

10



Third house — the breast

Fourth house — the heart

Fifth house — the belly

Sixth house — the waist

Seventh house — the groins

Eighth house — the private parts (Sexual organs)

Ninth house — the two thighs

Tenth house — the two knees

Eleventh house — the two calves

Twelfth house — the two feet

The end portions of the signs Cancer, Scorpio and Pisces are known as Rasi-

Sandhisj. There are other learneds who apply this term to the end portions of all 

signs.

Notes — The house which is occupied or aspected by benefits or whose lord 

is bestowed with strength, the part of the body represented by that house will be 

strong and well built. If the lord of a house be weak or be occupied or otherwise 

afflicted by a malefic, the corresponding part of the body will be weak or diseased.

5.  The dwelling of  the twelve signs Aries,  Taurus,  Gemini,  Cancer,  Leo, 

Virgo, Libra, Scorpio, Sagittarius, Capricorn, Aquarius and Pisces are — (1) forest 

(2) agricultural land with water (3) bedroom (4) chasm with water (5) mountain (6) 

land with water and food crops (7) house of a Vaishya (8) cavity or a hole (9) 

residence of the king (10) watery forests (11) the spot frequented or used by potters 

and (12) water, in that order.

Notes — Generally this information proves useful in queries regarding theft 

of articles or missing persons etc.

6. The lords of the twelve signs are as under:

Aries – Mars Libra - Venus

Taurus – Venus Scorpio - Mars

Gemini - Mercury Sagittarius - Jupiter

Cancer - The Moon Capricorn - Saturn

11



Leo - The Sun Aquarius - Saturn

Virgo - Mercury Pisces - Jupiter

The signs of exaltation and fall of the seven planets from the Sun onwards 

are as under —

Planet Sign of exaltation Sign of fall 
The Sun Aries Libra 
The Moon Taurus Scorpio 
Mars Capricorn Cancer 
Mercury Virgo Pisces 
Jupiter Cancer Capricorn 
Venus Pisces Virgo 
Saturn Libra Aries 

This means that the seventh or the opposite sign from the sign of exaltation 

of a planet, is the sign of fall or debilitation.

Notes— There is great difference of opinion amongst the ancient learneds 

about the exaltation and debilitation signs of  Rahu and Ketu.  Mantreswara has 

expressed  no  opinion  in  that  regard.  According  to  Sarvarth  Chintamani  the 

exaltation  sign  of  Rahu  is  Gemini  and  his  sign  of  debilitation  is  Sagittarius. 

Reverse is the case with Ketu. According to Brihat Parasara Hora Sastra Taurus 

and Scorpio are respectively the exaltation signs of Rahu and Ketu and the signs 

opposite to them are their signs of debilitation.

The highest points of exaltation and the lowest points of debilitation of the 

various planets are as under:

Planet Highest points of exaltation Lowest point of debilitation
(Deep exaltation) (Deep fall) 

The Sun Aries 10th degree Libra 10th degree 
The Moon Taurus 3rd degree Scorpio 3rd degree 
Mars Capricorn 28th degree Cancer 28th degree 
Mercury Virgo 15th degree Pisces 15th degree 
Jupiter Cancer 5th degree Capricorn 5th degree 
Venus Pisces 27th degree Virgo 27th degree 
Saturn Libra 20th degree Aries 20th degree 

Notes — For example Jupiter at the 5th degree of Cancer will be in deep 

exaltation. Then he moves downwards from that point and gets into deep debilition 

12



when he reaches 5th degree of Capricorn.

7. The Moolatrikona signs of the planets the Sun onward are Leo, Taurus, 

Aries,  Virgo,  Sagittarius,  Libra  and Aquarius  respectively.  Below are given the 

portions of the own sign and Moolatrikona from the Sun onwards :—

Planet Sign Moola trikona portion Own sign portion 
The Sun Leo 0° - 20° 21° - 30° 
The Moon Taurus 4° - 30° - 
Mars Aries 0° - 2° 13° - 30° 
Mercury Virgo 16° - 20° 21° - 30° 
Jupiter Sagittarius 0° - 10° 11° - 30° 
Venus Libra 0° - 5° 6° - 30° 
Saturn Aquarius 0° - 20° 21° - 30° 

The various signs have been classified as biped or human signs, reptile or 

(Keeta) or centipeds, watery or quadruped (Chatuspada) as detailed below :

Human Quadruped Centiped Watery 
Gemini Aries Scorpio Cancer 
Virgo Taurus  Capricorn 

(later half) 
Libra  Pisces  
Sagittarius Leo   
(first half) 
 Sagittarius   

(later half) 
Aquarius Capricorn   

(first half) 

8. The signs which rise with their back (Prishtodaya) are Taurus. Cancer, 

Aries  and  Capricorn.  The  signs  which  rise  both  from  their  back  and  front 

(Ubhayodaya) are Gemini and Pisces. The rest appear with their heads are called 

Sirsodaya signs.

The Prishtodaya signs Taurus, Cancer, Sagittarius, Aries and Capricorn and 

the  Ubhayodaya  sign  Gemini  fall  under  the  jurisdiction  of  the  Moon  and  are 

termed as nocturnal (strong at night). The other signs are governed by the Sun and 

are known as diurnal signs (strong during day time).

Count from the sign last passed by the Sun. The first sign is called Urdhawa 

13



(bending upwards) the second sign is known as Adah (beneath), the third sign is 

termed Sama (even) and the fourth sign is known as Vakra (Crooked). The same 

order applies for the other eight signs.

Notes — For example the Sun has last passed Virgo. Then the signs from 

Virgo to Leo will be in this order - Kanya - Urdhava, Adah, Even, Vakra, Urdhava, 

Adah, Even, Vakra, Urdhava, Adah, Even.

9.  The  following  are  some  farther  classifications  and  indications  of  the 

twelve signs —

Aries Moveable Entrance Mineral Fierce Odd East 
 (Chara) (Dwara) (Dhatu) (Krura) (Vlshama)  
Taurus Fixed Outside Vegetable Auspicious Even South 
 (Sthlra) (Bahih) (Mula) (Saumya) (Sama)

Scorpio Fixed Outside Vegetable Auspicious Even North 
Sagittarius Dual Inside Animal Fierce Odd East

Aquarius Fixed Outside Vegetable Fierce Odd West 
Pisces Dual Inside Animal Auspicious Even North 

The six houses from the 7th represent the left side limbs of the Kalapurusha, 

while the other six houses i.e. those reckoned from the Ascendant represent right 

side limbs.

10.  [In a  birth  chart  there are  twelve house.  Each house has been given 

several names indicating the various subjects it deals with.]

The names by which the first house or the Ascendant is known are Lagna, 

Hora, Kalya, Deha, Udaya, Rupa, Seersha, Vartmana (present) and Janma.

The  second  house  deals  with  Vitta  (wealth),  Vidya  (learning).  Swa, 

Annapana (riches, food and drinks), Bhukti (eating), the right eye, face (Asya), 

letter or document (Patrika), Speech (Vak) and Kutumba (family) and thus adopts 

these appellations.

14



11.-12.  — The names given  (or  the  subjects  allotted)  to  third  house  are 

Duschikya, Uras (breast), the right ear, army valour, prowess and brother.

The subjects or designations for the fourth house are house, land, maternal 

uncle,  a  sister's  son,  a  relation,  a  friend,  conveyance,  mother,  kingdom,  cow, 

buffalo, perfume, clothes, ornaments, the nadir, hibuka, sukha (happiness), water, 

bridge and river.

The fifth house deals with (and has designations accordingly) the mark of 

the  sovereign,  taxes,  soul,  intelligence,  knowledge  of  the  future,  life,  progeny, 

belly, Vedic knowledge and other religious scriptures.

13. — The sixth house deals with debts, arms, thieves, wounds, diseases, 

enemies, paternal relations, battle, wicked acts, sins, fear and humilialtion.

The subjects dealt  with by the seventh house are desire,  passion, setting, 

sexual desire, a way, people, husband road and wife.

14. — For the eighth house subjects allotted are Mangalya (the living of the 

husband during the life time of the wife), Randhra, filthiness, mental pain, defeat

The  ninth  house  deals  with  preceptor  (guru),  deity  (devta),  father, 

auspiciousness, poorvabhagya (previous luck), worship, penance, virtuous act or 

virtue, grand son, and noble family. (Some of the learneds in the North are of the 

view that all about father should be examined from the 10th house, because 10th is 

7th to the 4th house dealing with the father. The view of Phaladeepika seems to be 

based on the  logic  that  the  9th  being 5th  to  5th  house  (dealing with  progeny) 

should be the most appropriate house to be connected with father).

15. The subjects (names) designated for the 10th house are business or trade, 

ranker  position,  honour,  occupation,  profession,  sky or  zenith,  conduct,  quality, 

inclination, gait, command and Meshurana (to give orders).

The matters to be considered from the eleventh house are gains, income, 

acquisition,  receipt  of  wealth,  accomplishment,  splendor and prosperity,  profits, 

veneration, elder brother or sister, left ear, anything juicy, delightful news.

16. The expressions used for the twelfth house are misery, leg, left eye, loss, 

15



spy, last rites, poverty, sins, bad expenditure and imprisonment or confinement.

Described above are the designations of the twelve houses or the subject 

matters to be examined from them. The 3rd, the 6th, the 8th and 12th are known as 

Leena Sthanas (hidden houses).

17. The 6th, the 8th and 12th houses are also called Dusthanas (evil houses). 

The remaining houses are considered good and auspicious. The 1st, 4th, 7th and 

the 10th houses are termed as Kendra, Kantaka or Chatushtaya.

18. The 2nd, the 5th, the 8th and 11th houses from the Ascendant are called 

Panaphara houses. The 3rd, the 6th, the 9th and the 12th are termed as Apoklima 

houses. The 4th and the 8th are also known as Chaturasra houses. The 3rd, the 6th, 

the 10th and 11th are Upachaya houses. The 5th and 9th are called trines (Trikona 

houses). The trines have been considered as very auspicious houses.

Thus ends the  first chapter on "Definitions" in Phaladeepika composed by 

Mantreswara.

Chapter 2

Information and Characteristic features of planets

Before we come to the verses of this chapter it is necessary to explain its 

objects. In the previous chapter it has been described what each house stands for. It 

is  proposed to  state  in  this  chapter  what  purpose  and what  object  each  planet 

signifies.

If a house stands for a certain subject matter, the lord of the house will also 

be considered to  be  concerned with  it.  For  example,  the  6th  house  deals  with 

enemies. Naturally the same subject will have to be examined from the lord of the 

6th house. This is so because of his lordship of the 6th house. Here we have to 

consider also the natural or inherent characteristics and functions of that planet. Let 

us suppose that in ten birth charts, the Sun is lord of the ten different houses. There 

is doubt that as lord of the Ascendant Sun will function in that capacity and as lord 

of the 2nd. he will be concerned with wealth; but he will also, in course of its 

effects, will produce results of his inherent qualities and characteristics.  This is 

what is intended to be explained in this chapter.

1. The Sun is the singnificator of the person's collection of copper and gold, 

and of father, patience, valour, victory in war, one's soul (Atman), auspiciousness, 

happiness,  prowess,  power,  light,  any  work  relating  to  Lord  Shiva,  travels  in 

forests and mountains, havans or yajnas, Inclinations for work, temple, acuteness, 

enthusiasm. Wise men should act according to these significations.

2. The Moon is the signiflcator of the welfare of the mother, tranquilityof the 

mind, bathing in the sea, white chamar, umbrella, good fan, fruits, flowers, tender 

objects, farming grains, fame, pearls, silver, bell metal, beauty. In other words all 

about the above matters should be ascertained from the Moon.

3. All about one's strength (physical and mental), products produced from 

the earth, qualities of the brothers and sisters, cruelty, battle, courage, antagonism, 

the  fire  of  the  kitchen,  gold,  kinsmen,  weapons,  thieves,  enemies,  enthusiasm, 

sexual intercourse with another man's wife, falsehood, prowess, high thinking, sin, 

17



wounds,  and  acquisition  of  the  position  of  a  commander-in-chief  should  be 

ascertained from Mars.

In other words Mars is the signiflcator of these matters.

4.  From  Mercury  is  to  be  ascertained  all  about  learning,  eloquence, 

proficiency in arts, praise by learned people, maternal uncle, dexterity in speech, 

aptness  for  acquiring  knowledge,  expertise  in  ways  of  worship,  intelligence, 

religious acts relating to Lord Shiva, truthfulness, oyster, spots of recreation and 

enjoyment, skill in mechanical arts, kinsmen, heir apparent, friends, sister's sons 

and daughters etc.

5. Jupiter is concerned with matters relating to knowledge, noble qualities, 

sons  (progeny),  minister,  good  behavior,  imparting  knowledge  or  teaching, 

magnanimity, knowledge of shruties, shastras, smrities, progress in every direction, 

beautitude,  devotion  towards  gods  and  Brahmins,  sacrifice,  penance,  religious 

faith,  treasury,  mastering  the  senses,  honour,  kindness  and  happiness  of  the 

husband.

Note — In a female's horoscope Jupiter should be taken as the significator of 

the husband. In a male's horoscope Jupiter, among other matters, is the significator 

for progeny (San tan Karaka).

6.  All  about  one's  wealth,  conveyances,  clothes,  ornaments,  treasures 

(including  hidden  treasures),  amalgam of  song,  dance  and  instrumental  music, 

scents,  flowers,  co-habitation,  bed,  house,  richness,  fondness  for  poetry, 

Indulgence in all  kinds of comforts and luxuries,  ministership,  soft-spokenness, 

marriage and other holy deeds, celebrations, etc.,  should be ascertained through 

Venus.

Note — In a male's horoscope all about the happiness of wife and marital 

happiness should be considered through Venus. Venus is the significator for wife in 

such a chart.

Significator  is  of  very  great  importance  in  assessing  a  birth  chart.  For 

example on a particular case of Aquarius Ascendant, the native was of about 22 

years with the Dasa of Venus in operation.  Some astrologers predicted that the 

18



marriage of the native would take place in his 24th years after the commencement 

of the Dasa of the Sun lord of the 7th house. The marriage actually took place in 

the Dasa of Venus.

7. The significations of Saturn are longevity, death, fear, downfall, disgrace, 

sickness, unhappiness and misery, poverty, humiliation, sins, labour, filth, censure, 

misfortune, impurity of mind, observance of certain formalities after death in the 

family, stability, taking shelter from menials, buffaloe, drowsiness, debts, articles 

of iron, service, slavery, confinement, getting arrested, agricultural implements etc.

Notes — In verses 8 to 14 we shall deal with the features and temperament 

of the planets and their utility in the judgement of a birth chart. A planet in the 

Ascendant of a nativity bestows his qualities and characteristics to the native. If in 

a  person's  chart  Mars  is  in  the  Ascendant,  the  native  will  have  an  aggressive 

temperament. He will be courageous and fond of quarrels and fights. The sign in 

which Mars is posited in the Ascendant will also have its influence. If a Mars with 

strength is in the Ascendant, the native will fight wars with valour as a commander. 

If  such  Mars  is  weak,  the  native  is  likely  to  pick  up  petty  and  mean  type  of 

quarrels. If there is no planet in the Ascendant the native assumes the appearance 

and  characteristics  of  the  lord  of  the  Ascendant.  The  planets  who  aspect  the 

Ascendant also inject the Influence of their characteristics and temperament in the 

native. If a planet in any chart becomes the cause of any disease, the nature of the 

disease will be according to the temperament of that planet. For example, the Sun 

will cause bilious troubles and Saturn will give windy troubles.

8. The temperament of the Sun is bilious. He has strong bones in his body. 

He has scanty hair. He has a dark red form. His eyes are of reddish-brown color. 

He is dressed in red colored clothes. His body is square built.  He is brave and 

possesses massive arms.

9. The body of the Moon is huge. She is young as well as old. She is lean 

and thin and white. Her eyes are attractive and her hair is black and thin. She has 

jurisdiction over blood. She is soft-spoken. She is dressed in white colored clothes 

and possesses  fair  complexion.  She  is  mild  in  temperament  and has  wind and 

19



phlegm in her composition.

10.  Mars  has  lean  waist.  His  hair  is  curly  and  bright.  There  is  cruelty 

(fierceness) in his look. He has a cruel nature and is bilious. He is dressed in red 

clothes and his body has a red hue. He is wrathful but exceedingly generous. He 

looks youthful and has jurisdiction over marrow in the body.

Notes — Mars is said to be youthful in appearance. The implication of this 

is if Mars is strong in the Ascendant or as lord of the Ascendant, the native will 

have a youthful appearance even if he is older in age.

11. Mercury is green like Durva (a kind of grass). There is mixture of wind, 

bile and phlegm in his composition. His body is full of veins. He is soft-spoken by 

nature. He has a balanced built (that is, his limbs are in even proportion). He is

His chest is firm and elevated. He has a huge body. Phlegm is predominant in his 

composition. He is very intelligent. His voice is like that of a lion or the sound of a 

conch.  He  is  always  after  wealth  (Jupiter  has  therefore  been  considered  as 

signiflcator of wealth).

13. Venus is dressed in clothes of various colors. He possesses curly hair. He 

has a  huge body with  similar  limbs.  Phlegm and wind are  predominant  in  his 

composition. His body is of the color of Durva sprout. He has a very beautiful 

appearance. He has broad eyes. He has well maintained his virile power (Venus has 

jurisdiction over semen in the body).

veins. He is lazy by nature. The color of his body is black. There is predominance 

of wind in his composition. He is hard hearted and backbiter. He is dull-headed. 

His teeth and nails are large. His hair and limbs are stiff. He is impure. He has a 

fierce appearance and is ill tempered by nature. He is dressed in black clothes. He 

looks old.

15. The places governed by the Sun are a Shiva temple, open spaces, places 

where there is light, regions where there is no water and the Eastern quarter.

20



The  Moon  has  jurisdiction  over  the  temple  of  Goddess  Durga,  places 

inhabited by women, places where water,  medicinal  herbs, honey and wine are 

available and the North-Western quarter.

The places concerned with Mars are the battle field, those where there is 

fire, those inhabited by thieves and low people and the Southern quarter.

The governance of Mercury extends to places where there is a temple of 

Lord Vishnu, those frequented by men of learning, those of recreation, those where 

Mathematics is practiced and the Northern quarter.

expert accountant, a devotee of Lord Vishnu, Garuda, a Chataka, a parrot and a cat.

An astrologer, a minister, a Brahmin, a preceptor, a sanyasi, and important 

personage, a pigeon, a horse and swan belong to Jupiter.

A wealthy man, a songster, a Vaishya (businessman), a sensualist, a dancer, a 

weaver, a prostitute, a peacock, a cow, a buffaloe and a parrot are represented by 

21



Venus.

A Buddhist, a snake catcher, a donkey, a wolf, a camel, a serpent or snake, 

mosquitoes, a bug, insects, an owl and a place of darkness are signified by Rahu 

and Ketu.

21-22.  In  these  verses  has  been  described  the  friendship,  enmity  and 

neutrality  of the various planets to each other.  This is  summarized in the table 

given below:

Planet Friend Neutral Enemy

23. Planets are mutually friendly for the time being when they occupy the 

2nd,  3rd,  4th,  10th,  11th  and  12th  houses  from one  another.  (This  means  that 

planets occupying the 1st, 5th, 6th 7th, 8th, and 9th from one another are mutually 

inimical). After taking into account the natural friendship and enmity, it should be 

deduced  whether  they  are  friendly,  very  friendly,  neutral,  inimical  and  very 

inimical to one another.

Note — Apart from the neutral or natural friendship and enmity amongst the 

planets, account is taken of the for the time being (Tatkalik) enmity and friendship 

22



amongst the planets as posited in a particular birth chart. The planets posited in the 

2nd, 3rd, 4th, 10th, 11th and 12th from a particular planet are his friends for the 

time being. The 1st, 5th, 6th, 7th, 8th and 9th from him become his enemies for the 

time being. After taking into account the natural relationship, we come to know 

what their  actual  relationship  is  in a  particular  birth  chart.  This  is  done in the 

following manner :

1. Natural friend + Temporary friend = Best friend 
(Naisargik mitra) (Tatkalik Mitra) (Adhimitra) 

2. Natural friend + Temporary enemy = Neutral 
(Naisargik Mitra) (Tatkalik Shatru (Sama) 

3. Natural enemy + Temporary enemy = Bitter enemy 
(Naisargik (Tatakalik Shatru) (Adhishatru) 
Shatru) 

4. Natural enemy + Temporary friend = Neutral 
(Naisargik (Tatkalik Mitra) (Sama) 
Shatru) 

5. Natural neutral + (Temporary Friend = Friend (Mitra) 
(Naisargik Sama) (Tatkalik Mitra) 

6. Natural neutral + Temporary enemy = Enemy 
(Naisargik Sama) (Tatkalik Shatru) (Shatru) 

All planets cast a quarter glance at the 3rd and 10th houses, half a glance at 

the 5th and 9th houses, three-quarters of a glance at the 4th and 8th houses and full 

glance at the 7th house. However, the aspects of Saturn on the 3rd and 10th houses 

from him, of Jupiter on the 5th and 9th houses from him and of Mars on the 4th 

and 8th houses are also treated as full aspects.

24. The following table shows the periods, castes, gunas (Satwa, Rajas, and 

Tamas) and the seasons governed by the various planets according to this verse.

Planet Period Caste Guna Season 
Sun Half a year Kshatriya Satwik Grishma

Venus is the signiflcator of mother if the birth is during day time and of 

maternal aunt if the birth takes place at night.

Saturn represents the uncle if the birth takes place during the day and of 

father if the birth is during night time.

26. The Sun represents the soul and the Moon the body. Mars and the other 

four  planets  denote  the  five  senses.  The  Sun  and  Mars  govern  Teja  and  have 

influence over eye sight.  The Moon and Venus rule over the generative organs 

because they govern the watery element.  Mercury governs smell (nose). Jupiter 

governs sound (the capacity to hear). Saturn, Rahu and Ketu govern the touch.

Rahu, Ketu and Gulik are enemies of the Sun and will cause distress to the 

body and the soul.

27. The waning Moon, the Sun, Mars, Saturn, Rahu and Ketu are classified 

as malefic planets. Mercury if associated with them becomes malefic.

Notes — The waxing Moon and Mercury not associated with malefics will 

be treated as benefic.

Mercury,  Ketu  and Saturn  are  eunuchs.  The Moon,  Rahu and Venus are 

females.  The  Sun,  Mars  and  Jupiter  are  males.  The  Sun  belongs  to  the  fiery 

element and his ruling deity is Rudra. The Moon belongs to the watery element and

Notes — The purpose of indicating the gems ruled by the various planets is 

to  use  them  for  alleviating  the  miseries  caused  by  their  malevolence  and  to 

accelerate  their  good effects.  For fuller  details  in this  regard refer to our book 

"Gems and Astrology" published by Rajan Publications.

30-32.  The  substances  assigned  to  the  planets  from  the  Sun  to  Saturn,

Notes — The above information is generally useful in queries.

33. Rahu is blue colored. He has a huge body. He is of a low caste. He has 

got skin disease. He is irreligious. He suffers from hic-cough.

out. An earthen pot and garments of variegated colors belong to Ketu.

Mercury, Saturn and Venus are the friends of Rahu and Ketu. Mars is neutral 

to them. The rest are enemies.

36. The planets should be considered adversely disposed, if they are eclipsed 

(by the rays of the Sun), debilitated (be in a sign of debilitation or Navamsa), if 

they are in any enemy's house or if they occupy the 6th, 8th or the 12th house from 

the Ascendant. If they occupy other places, they are said to be well disposed.

If  there  be  a  query  whether  the  water  in  a  reservoir  (or  in  an  irrigation 

project)  will  increase  or  decrease,  increase  in  water  should  be  predicted  if  the 

Moon be in the 12th 11th, 1st, 6th. 5th or the 7th house at the time of the query.

Notes — The Moon is said to be eclipsed if she is 12° away from the Sun. 

26



Mars is eclipsed when he is 17° away from the Sun. Mercury in direct motion is 

eclipsed when he is 14° away from the Sun. Retrograde Mercury is eclipsed when 

he is 12° away form the Sun. Jupiter, Venus and Saturn are said to be eclipsed if 

they are 11°, 10° and 15° respectively away from the Sun. A retrograde Venus is

jurisdiction of Saturn. Saal trees are ruled by Rahu.

Thus ends  the  second  chapter  on  "Planets  and  their  Varieties"  In  

Phaladeepika composed by Mantreswara.

Chapter 3

Divisions of a sign

1. The ten-fold division of the Zodiac is known as Dasa vargas (Vargas mean 

divisions). Under the scheme of Dasavarga the various divisions are as Under :—

(1) Rasi Each Rasi 30° 
(2) Hora 2 parts of a Rasi of 15° each. 
(3) Drekkana 3 parts of a Rasi of 10° each. 
(4) Trimsamsa 5 parts of 5°, 7° or 8° each. (All parts 

are not equal) 
(5) Saptamsa 7 parts of 4°-17"-8" each. 
(6) Navamsa 9 parts of 3°-20 each. 
(7) Dasmamsa 10 parts of 3°each. 
(8) Dwadasamsa 12 parts of 2°-30' each. 
(9) Shodasamsa 16 parts of l°-16'-52" each. 
(10) Shastyamsa 60 parts of 30' each. 

Vargottama is the name given to that particular Navamsa in a Rasi which 

bears the same sign as that of Rasi itself.

2.  If  amongst  the  ten  vargas  only  the  Rasi,  Hora,  Drekkana,  Navamsa, 

Dwadasamsa and Trimsamsa are taken into consideration, the divisions are known 

as Shad vargas. If we add Saptamsa division to them, the 7 kinds of divisions are 

known as Sapta vargas.

Some learneds have taken the view that the effect emanating from Navamsa 

is equal to that of Rasi and Bhava.

3. In Rasis the effect is full. In the Shodasamsa, Dasmamsa and Shastyamsa 

divisions (Vargas) it is one-fourth. In the other vargas it is half. In an odd Rasi, the 

planets are said to be in 'infancy, in boyhood, youth, in middle age and in very old 

age  (near  death),  according  to  first,  second,  third,  fourth  and  last  six  degree 

portions respectively reached by them in a sign. But in an even sign this is in the 

reverse order.

Notes — In Aries,  Gemini,  Leo,  Libra,  Sagittarius  and Aquarius there is 

infancy up to 6 degrees, up to 12° boyhood, from there to 18° it is youth and up to 

28



24° it is middle age and the last 6° comprise the very old age. It is reverse in the 

case of even signs viz., Taurus, Cancer, Virgo, Scorpio, Capricorn and Pisces.

4. Hora is half of a Rasi. In an odd sign, the halves belong, to the Sun and 

the Moon and to the Moon and the Sun when the sign is an even one.

The Drekkana or third portions of a sign belong to the lords of the sign itself, 

of the 5th house and of the 9th house.

The owners of the Dwadasamas or l/12th portion of a sign are counted from 

that sign.

In an odd sign the Trimsamsas or degrees, that is, l/30th portions belonging 

to Mars, Saturn, Jupiter, Mercury and Venus are respectively 5, 5, 8, 7 and 5. In an 

even sign it is reversed. Then Venus. Mercury, Jupiter, Saturn and Mars have 5, 7, 

8, 5 and 5 degrees respectively.

The first Navamsa in the signs from Aries onwards begins respectively with 

Aries, Capricorn, Libra and Cancer.

5. In an odd sign in Krura Shastyamsas or inauspicious l/60th portions are 

1st. 2nd, 8th, 9th. 10th, 11th. 12th. 15th, 18th, 30th, 31st. 32nd. 33rd. 34th, 35th, 

39th. 40th, 42nd, 43rd, 44th. 48th, 51st. 52nd and 59th. The rest are Saumya or 

auspicious ones. In the case of an even sign it is necessary, that is, the Shastyamsa 

portions stated Krura in the odd signs are the Saumya ones in the even signs and 

vice versa.

6. The Saptamsas or the l/7th portion are in the case of an odd sign, counted 

regularly from the sign itself. In the case of an even sign, they are counted from 7th 

sign onwards.

In the case of an odd sign, the Dasamamsas or 1/10th portions are counted 

from the sign itself. In the case of an even sign, they are counted from the 9th 

onwards. The lords of the Shodasamsas or the 1/16th portions in the case of an odd 

sign are those of the 12th sign counted from that sign Brahma, Vishnu, Hora and 

Ravi. In an even sign this is reversed.

If we have to assess the comparative strength of a planet, we should find out 

whether he is in a kendra, trikona, in his own sign, in his moolatrikona sign, in his 

29



sign  of  exaltation  or  is  vargottama.  Then  we  should  scrutinize  its  portion  in 

Dasavarga or Saptavarga. Some make the assessment only from Dasavarga, others 

assess the strength and auspiciousness of a planet from thirteen vargas.

7. The position of a planet has to be considered with reference to 13 vargas 

to ascertain whether he is in his friend's house, his own house or in his house of 

exaltation. The number of such vargas obtained by the planet will  result  in the 

attainment of the following kinds of vaiseshikamsas. The combination of 2, 3. 4, 5, 

6. 7, 8 and 9 vargas are respectively called Parijat, Uttama, Gopura, Simhasana, 

Parvata. Devaloka, Suraloka and Airavata.

Shri V. Subrahmanya Sastri in his English Translation and Commentary of 

this work has given the following example. Suppose Jupiter's position is 8-l°-25'-l" 

or the 2nd Degree of Dhanus. He occupies his (1) Moolatrikona (2) Drekkana (3) 

Saptamsa (4) Dasamsa (5) Dwadasamsa and (5) Shodasamsa. Thus Jupiter should 

be declared to have attained a Parvatamsa.

8-9. The results of a planet attaining various Vaiseshikamsas are as follows:

Parijat amsa — Respectability, good qualities, wealth, happiness, authority 

and dignity.

Uttamamsa — Modest, clever and well-behaved.

Gopuramsa — Intelligence, wealth, acquisition of lands, cows and house.

Simhasanamsa — Makes the native friend of a king or equal to him.

Paravatamsa — Acquisition of good houses, elephants, vehicles and other 

princely appendages.

Devalokamsa — Kingship, renown for good qualities.

Suralokamsa  —  Endowment  with  good  fortune,  acquisition  of  wealth, 

grains, and kingship and birth of children.

10. If in a nativity a planet be weak in all the 10 vargas the result will be the 

death of the native. If the planets be weak in 9, 8, 7, 6, 5, 4, 3, 2, 1 out of the 10 

vargas the results will be as follows: —

9 Vargas — Destruction of the native.

8 Vargas — Grief to the native.

30



7 Vargas — Calamity.

6 Vargas — Unhappiness.

5 Vargas — Love of kinsmen

4 Vargas — Foremost in the family

3 Vargas — Friend of a king

2 Vargas — Wealthy

1 Varga — Kingship

If a planet be strong in all the 10 Vargas, the native will be a king of kings.

A planet in infancy makes the native progressing. If he is in boyhood the 

native achieves happiness. If the planet be adolescent, he endows the native with 

kingship. The native suffers from ill  health If the planet be in middle age. The 

planet in old age causes death of the native.

Notes — This means that a planet from infancy to youth gives progressively 

auspicious results and from middle age to old age the results are inauspicious.

11. If the benefic planets be endowed with strength in the Shadvargas, the 

native will be wealthy and longlived. If the Ascendant falls in the Krura amsas in 

the Shadvargas, the native will be shortlived, poor and of wicked disposition but if 

the lord of Amsas in which the Ascendant falls, be strong, the person concerned 

will become a king (a person with a high status political or administrative).

If the lord of the Navamsa of the Ascendant be strong, the native will be lull 

of happiness. If the lord of the Drekkana of the Ascendant be strong, the person 

concerned will achieve the status like that of a king. If the lord of the Ascendant 

itself be strong, the native will become the ruler of the Earth and will enjoy good 

fortune.

12. If in any nativity, malefics being in odd signs fall In the Sun's Hora (first 

15 degrees), the native will be cruel strong and wealthy. Opposite to this, if the 

benefics being In even signs occupy the Moon's Hora (first 15 degrees), the native 

will be lustrous, humble, soft-spoken, graceful and fortunate. If it be otherwise, the 

results will also be of the same nature. If the dispositions be of mixed nature, the 

results may be expected accordingly.

31



If in any nativity, the Ascendant and the Moon be both strong and the lords 

of the Ascendant and the Moon's sign be also equally strong, the native will be 

long-lived, happy and renowned.

13. The appearances of the Drekkanas are as under The last Drekkanas or 

decanats  of  Leo,  Aries,  Sagittarius,  Libra  and  Gemini,  the  first  decanates  of 

Sagittarius  and Aries  and second ones of  Virgo and Gemini are called Ayudha 

Drekkanas or 'armed' decanates. The second decanate of Scorpio is called 'Pasa' 

(noose). The first decanate of Capricorn is called 'Nigala'. The first decanates of 

Leo and Aquarius and second one of Libra are vulture faced. The first decanate of 

Taurus is like a 'Pakshi' (bird) and the first decanate of Cancer has a face like a pig.

14. The first decanate of Scorpio and third ones of Cancer and Pisces are 

called Serpent decanates. The second decanates of Aries and Taurus, the first of 

Leo and last of Scorpio are named as quadruped decanates.

The persons born when these decanates are rising will be poor, cruel and 

unscrupulous.

In a  dual  sign,  the  three  decanates in  their  order  will  be  Adhama (bad), 

Madhyama (moderate) and Uttama (good).  In the case of a moveable sign, the 

order is reversed, that is, the first will be Uttama and the second madhyama and the 

last Adhama. In a fixed sign the order will be Adhama, Uttama and Madhyama. 

The effects will be in accordance with the names of the decanates.

15. If the lord of the Lagna Drekkana be in his own varga, be associated 

with  a  benefic  or  be  in  his  sign  of  exaltation  or  friendly  house;  if  the  rising 

Trimsamsa, Dwadasamsa or Hora endowed with strength be in a similar position, 

the native will be gifted with all noble qualities, will be pure, clever, longlived 

sympathetic and wealthy, will be blessed with children, will be widely renowned 

and will enjoy royal comforts.

16. Note the Rasi of Mandi at birth and also where the lord of that Rasi is 

posited. The Ascendant at birth will be in a house 5th or 9th to that of the aforesaid 

lord or one triangular to the Navamsa occupied by the lord of the Rasi representing 

the Navamsa occupied by the Mandi. It may be triangular to the Navamsa Rasi 

32



occupied  by  Gulika.  But  if  the  Moon  be  strong,  the  Ascendant  should  be 

ascertained similarly through the Moon and not through Mandi.

17. The person concerned will be gifted with attractive appearance and good 

qualities, if the Moon be in his own Drekkana or a friend's decanate. If the Moon 

has  attained  an  Uttama  varga,  the  native  will  be  fortunate.  If  she  is  posited 

elsewhere, the native will be endowed with qualities belonging to the planet who is 

the lord of the Moon's sign. Planets that are in their own Trimsamsa will do all that 

has ascribed to them as Karakas.

The native will be wealthy like a king if there be at least one planet in his 

own exaltation house aspected by or associated with a friendly planet.

18-19.  A planet  is  called  Pradeepta  (blazing)  when  he  is  in  his  sign  of 

exaltation. He is Sukhita (happy) when he is in Moolatrikona Rasi. He is called 

Swastha  (healthy)  when  he  is  in  his  own sign.  He  is  Mudita  (delighted)  in  a 

friendly house. He is Shanta (calm) when he has attained the varga of a benefic 

planet. He is Shakta (capable) when he shines brightly (not combust by being near 

the  Sun).  A planet  is  Vikala  (distressed)  when  he  is  combust.  He  is  Nlpidita 

(troubled-tortured) when he is overcome in the planetary war by another planet. He 

is Khala (base) when he is in the varga of a malefic. He is Sudukhit (exceedingly 

unhappy), he is Atibheeta (very afraid) when he is in his sign of debilitation.

20. The planet in Pradeepta Avastha gives good effects In full. They will be 

nil when he is In Vikala Avastha. In the intervening Avasthas the auspicious effects 

will  be  decreasing  proportionately  and  the  inauspicious  effects  will 

correspondingly increase.  The Avasthas of the  planet  will  determine the effects 

according to the names given to them.

The good or  bad  effects  in  various  Avasthas  are  approximately  as  given 

below: —

Pradeepta — 100 per cent good. Sukhita — 80 per cent good. Swastha — 75 

per cent good. Mudita — 60 per cent good. Shanto — 50 per cent good. Shakta — 

40 per cent good. Nipidita—40 per cent bad. Khata—50 per cent bad. Sudukhito—

60 per cent bad. Attbheeta—75 per cent bad. Vikala—100 per cent bad.

33



The planets  in  good avasthas yield  favourable  effects  in their  Dasas and 

Antardasas. The reverse is the case with planets in adverse avasthas.

Thus ends the third chapter on "Divisions of the Zodiac" in Phaladeepika  

composed by Mantreswara.

Chapter 4

The various kinds of Strengths of Planets and Houses

This Chapter deals with as to how to assess the strength of the planets and 

houses  (bhavas).  In  this  connection  before  mentioning  the  view  of  Shri 

Mantreswara, it will be useful to know the views of other ancients.

Six  kinds  of  strength  of  planets  is  an  important  and  very  instructive 

contribution of Hindu Astrology. According to our sapient learneds the six kinds of 

strengths are (1) Sthan Bala, (2) Drik Bala, (3) Kala Bala, (4) Chesta Bala, (5) 

Naisargik Bala, and (6) Ayana Bala.

Sthan Bala — This is of the following twelve kinds:—

(1) Uchcha Bala —A planet at his deep exaltation point, is allotted 1 Rupa 

(60 Shastayamsa). If he is at his deep debilitation point, his strength is nil. At the 

intervening positions the strength has to be worked out by the rule of three. This is 

known as Uchcha Bala.

(2)  If  a  planet  is  in  his  Moolatrikona  Rasi  he  gets  36  Shastayamsa  of 

strength. In the Rasi of Adhimitra he gets 22.5 Shastayamsa and 15 Shastayamsa if 

he is in the sign of a friend. He gets 7.5 Shastayamsa in a neutral Rasi, 3.75 in the 

Rasi of an enemy and 1.875 Shastayamsa in the Rasi of Adhishatru.

(3) He gets 30 Shastayamsa in his own Hora, 22.5 Shastayamsa in the Hora 

of Adhimitra, 15 Shastayamsa in the Hora of a friend, 7.5 Shastayamsa in the Hora 

of a neutral, 3.75 Shastayamsa in the Hora of an enemy and 1.875 Shastayamsa 

only in the Hora of a Adhishatru.

(4) He gets 30 Shastayamsa strength in his own decanate, 22.5 Shastayamsa 

in the decanate of an Adhimitra, 15 Shastayamsa in the decanate of a friend, 7.5 

Shastayamsa in the decanate of a neutral, 3.75 Shastayamsa in the decanate of an 

enemy and 1,875 Shastayamsa in the decanate of Adhishatru.

(5) He gets 30 Shastayamsa in his own Saptamsa, 22.5 in the Saptamsa of 

Adhimitra, 15 in the Saptamsa of a friend, 7.5 in the Saptamsa of a neutral, 3.75 in 

the  Saptamsa  of  an  enemy  and  1.875  Shastayamsa  in  the  Saptamsa  of  an 

35



Adhishatru.

(6) He gets 30 Shastayamsa of strength in his own Navamsa. 22.5 in the 

Navamsa of an Adhimitra, 15 in the Navamsa of a friend. 7.5 in the Navamsa of a 

neutral, 3.75 in the Navamsa of an enemy and only 1.875 in the Navamsa of an 

Adhishatru.

(7) A planet gets 30 Shastayamsa of strength if he is in own Dwadasamsa, 

22.5 in the Dwadasamsa of his Adhimitra, 15 in the Dwadasamsa of a friend, 7.5 in 

the Dwadasamsa of his neutral, 3.75 in the Dwadasamsa of his enemy and 1.875 in 

the Dwadasamsa of his Adhishatru.

(8)  A planet  gets  30  Shastayamsa  in  his  own  Trimsamsa,  22.5  in  the 

Trimsamsa  of  his  Adhimitra,  15  in  the  Trimsamsa  of  his  friend,  7.5  in  the 

Trimsamsa of his neutral, 3.75 in the Trimsamsa of his enemy and 1.875 in the 

Trimsamsa of his Adhishatru.

(9) (a) The Sun, Mars, Mercury and Saturn amongst those five whoever is in 

an Oja Rasi  (viz.  Aries,  Gemini,  Leo,  Libra,  Sagittarius  and Aquarius)  gets  15 

Shastayamsa.

(b) Amongst the Moon and Venus, whoever is in Yugma (Taurus, Cancer, 

Virgo, Scorpio, Capricorn or Pisces) Navamsa, gets 15 Shastayamsas.

(11)  A planet  in  Kendra  Rasi  gets  1  Rupa  (60  Shastayamsa).  That  in  a 

Panaphara  Rasi  gets  30  Shastayamsa  and  on  an  Apoklima  Rasi  gets  15 

Shastayamsa.

(12) (a) Amongst the Sun, Mars and Jupiter whoever is in the first Drekkana 

gets 15 Shastayamsa of strength. In other Drekkanas they get no strength at all.

(b) Amongst Saturn and Mercury, whoever is in the 2nd Drekkana, gets 15 

Shastayamsa of strength.

(c) Amongst the Moon and Venus, whoever is in the last Drekkana. gets 15 

Shastayamsa of strength.

These 12 combinations are known as Sthan Bala. In Sanskrit they are called, 

(1)  Uchcha Bala, (2) — (8)  Saptavarga Bala, (9)  Oja Yugma Rasi Bala. (10) 

Oja-Yugma navamsa Bala, (11) Kendradi Bala and (12) Dreshtakana Bala. 

36



Drik bala (Directional strength)

(a) Amongst the Sun and Mars, whoever Is the 10th Bhava madhya (South) 

gets 1 Rupja strength. Their strength is nil if they are located in the 4th Bhava 

madhya.  In  the  intervening  locations,  the  strength  has  to  be  calculated 

proportionately.

(b) Amongst the Moon and Venus, whoever is in 4th Bhava madhya (North) 

gets 1 Rupa of strength. Their strength is nil if they are located in the 10th Bhava 

madhya.  In  the  intervening  locations  their  strength  has  to  be  calculated 

proportionately.

(c) Amongst Mercury and Jupiter, whoever is in the Bhava madhya of the 

1st Bhava (Lagna) (East) get 1 Rupa of strength. Their strength is nil if located in 

7th Bhava madhya (West).

(d) If Saturn is in the 7th Bhava madhya, he gets 1 Rupa of strength. In the 

1st Bhava madhya his strength is nil. In the intervening locations the strength has 

to be calculated proportionately.

Kala Bala

This is admixture of the kinds of strength as described below: —

(1) (a) The Sun, Jupiter and Venus get 1 Rupa of strength exactly at mid-

noon. Exactly at mid-night they are devoid of any strength. For the intervening 

periods the strength has to be calculated proportionately.

(b)  The Moon,  Mars and Saturn get  one Rupa of strength if  the birth is 

exactly at mid-night. Exactly at mid-noon, their strength is nil. For the intervening 

periods, the strength has to be calculated proportionately.

(c) Mercury gets one Rupa of strength if the birth be at any time during the 

day time.

(2) (a) When the Sun and the Moon are at a distance of 180° from each 

other, the benefics get one Rupa of strength. When they are together the benefics 

get  no  strength  at  all.  For  the  intervening  distances,  the  strength  has  to  be 

calculated proportionately.

The Moon, Mercury, Jupiter and Venus are benefics. Keshavi Jatak is of the 

37



view that  Mercury  if  associated  with  a  malefic  becomes  a  malefic.  But  some 

Acharyas are of the view that for determining kala Bala Mercury should be treated 

as a benefic. We support this view.

(b) When the Sun and the Moon are In the same sign and the same degree, 

the malefics get 60 Shastayamsa (one Rupa of Kala Bala). If they are (the Sun and 

the Moon) 180° away from each other, the Kala bala of the malefics will be nil In 

the intervening distances, the strength is to be worked out proportionately.

The Sun, Mars and Saturn are malefics.

This strength is known as Paksha Bala which comes under the purview of 

Kala Bala.

(c) The Paksha Bala of the Moon should be doubled (the Moon is never 

retrograde.  Therefore  it  never  gets  Chesta  Bala.  Therefore,  Paksha Bala  of  the 

Moon is doubled).

(3)  (a)  Divide the Dinamana (the time between Sunrise  and Sunset)  into 

three parts, if the birth is during the day. If the birth be in the first part Mercury 

will get one Rupa of Paksha Bala. If the birth be in the second part of Dinamana, 

the Sun will get one Rupa of Paksha Bala. If the birth be in the 3rd part, Saturn will 

get one Rupa of this strength.

(b) Divide the Ratrimana (the time between Sunset and Sunrise) into three 

parts, if the birth be during the night. If the birth be in the first part, the Moon will 

get one Rupa of strength. If the birth be in the second part, Venus will get one Rupa 

of this strength, and if the birth be in the third part Mars will get similar quantum 

of strength.

(c)  Jupiter  will  get  one Rupa of  this  strength if  the birth be at  any time 

during the 24 hours.

(4) One year is of 360 days and one month is of 30 days Find out the day of 

the week from which the year commences, the lord of that day becomes the lord of 

the year. The lord of the year gets 15 Shastayamsa of strength.

(5)  Similarly  find  out  the  day  of  the  week  from  which  the  month 

commences, the lord of that day gets 30 Shastayamsa of strength.

38



(6) The lord of the day in which birth takes place, gets 45 Shastayamsa of 

strength.

(7) The planet in whose hora the birth takes place gets one Rupa of strength.

Ayana Bala

(8) From the centre line of the sky some planets are in the north. Then they 

are said to have northern declination. If they are in the South they are said to have 

southern declination. One exactly on the centre line has no declination.

(a) If the Sun, Moon, Jupiter and Venus have 24° of northern declination 

they get 1 Rupa of Ayana Bala. This strength is nil if they have 24° of southern 

declination.  For  the  intervening  declinations,  the  strength  has  to  be  looked 

proportionately.

(b) The Moon and Saturn get one Rupa of Ayana Bala when they have 24° of 

Southern  declinations.  For  the  intervening  declinations,  the  strength  has  to  be 

worked out proportionately.

(c) Mercury has been given special consideration in this respect. He gets 30 

Shastayamsa of Ayana Bala if his declination is 0 degree. The strength increases 

with the increase in declination from 0°-24° and he will get one Rupa of Ayana 

Bala when he has 24° of northern declination. He also gets one Rupa of strength 

when his southern declination is 24°. For the intervening degrees of northern and 

southern declinations, the strength has to be calculated proportionately.

(d) The Ayan Bala obtained by the Sun is to be doubled because the Sun is 

always direct and never retrograde. As he does not get any Chesta Bala, his Ayana 

Bala is doubled.

Yudha Bala

(9) This is the ninth kind of strength under the heading 'Kala Bala'. Besides 

the Sun and the Moon if amongst the other planets (Mars, Mercury, Jupiter, Venus 

and Saturn) any two be in the same Rasi, degree and minute, they are considered to 

be at war. For the method to work out Yudha Bala, refer to Sripati Padhati, Keshavi 

Jataka or Brihat Parasara Hora Shastra.

Chesta Bala

39



The Sun and the Moon are never retrograde in their motions. The remaining 

planets  viz.  Mars,  Mercury,  Jupiter.  Venus  and  Saturn  have  both  direct  and 

retrograde  motions.  The  strength  which  the  planets  obtain  by  virtue  of  their 

motions is called Chesta Bala (Motional strength). To work out this strength the 

facts regarding Mandoucha, Kshetra and Kendra etc., have to be worked out. This 

involves lot of arithmetical calculations. It is not possible to give those details here 

for lack of space. Still some information in this regard is given below —

(a) If the planet is retrograde he gets 60 Shastayamsa (one Rupa) of strength.

(b) If he is Anuvakra he gets 30 Shastayamsa of strength.

(c) If he is Vikala, he gets 15 Shastayamsa of strength.

(d) If he is in Samagama, he gets 30 Shastayamsa of strength.

(e) If he is Manda (This means motion be increasing but be less than the 

medium motion) and direct he gets 15 Shastayamsa of strength.

(f)  If  he  is  Mandatara  (The motion  be  decreasing but  be  more  than  the 

medium motion) and direct, he gets 15 Shastayamsa of strength).

(g) If the motion be fast and be direct, he gets 45 Shastayamsa of strength.

(h) If motion be faster, and direct, he obtains 30 Shastayamsa of strength.

Naisargik Bala (Inherent strength)

This strength is inherent in the planet and never changes.

The Naisargik Bala of the Sun is  60 Shastayamsa,  of the Moon 51.3, of 

Venus 42.85, of Jupiter 34.28, of Mercury 25.70, of Mars 17.14 and of Saturn 8.57 

Shastayamsa.

Drig Bala

This  kind  of  strength  is  derived  from aspect.  If  a  planet  is  aspected  by 

benefics, the aspect is considered as benefic (favourable). To work out the strength 

of aspect, the difference in degrees etc., of the aspecting and aspected planet has to 

be worked out arithmetically.

If  any  planet  is  aspected  by  malefics,  the  aspect  is  treated  as  malefic 

(unfavourable). The strength of the aspect is to be worked out arithmetically. For 

details see Sripati Padhati.

40



Bhava Bala (The strength of houses or Bhavas)

In working out the strength of houses the strength of the following has to be 

calculated —

(1) The strength of the lord of the house.

(2) The Dik Bala of the house

(3) The strength of the benefic aspects.

Bhava Dik Bala

(a) Gemini, Virgo, Libra and first part of Sagittarius are biped signs. If these 

signs be in the Lagna, they obtain one Rupa of strength. If they be in the 7th, the 

strength will be nil. For the intervening houses, the strength has to be worked out 

proportionately.

(b)  Aries,  Taurus,  Leo,  the  latter  half  of  Sagittarius  and the  first  half  of 

Capricorn are quadruped signs. If they represent the 10th house, they achieve one 

Rupa of strength. In the 4th house, their strength will  be nil.  In between other 

houses the strength has to be calculated proportionately.

(c) Cancer and Scorpio are Keeta signs. If they represent the 7th house, they 

get  one Rupa of  strength.  In the first  house,  their  strength will  be nil.  For the 

intervening houses, the strength has to be calculated proportionately.

(d) Pisces and the latter half of Capricorn are watery signs (Jala Rasis). If 

they represent the fourth house, they obtain one Rupa of strength. In the 10th house 

their strength will be nil. For the intervening houses the strength will have to be 

calculated proportionately.

Auspicious and Inauspicious Drishti (as per Bold)

If there be more of  benefic aspect on a house, deduct quantum of malefic 

aspect from it and the strength of the lord of the house and add Bhawa Dik Bala to 

it. The result will be the total strength of the house.

If the malefic aspects are more than the benefic aspects, deduct the quantum 

of the latter from that of the former. Further deduct the result from the total of the 

strength of the lord of the house and Bhava Dik Bala. The net result will be the 

strength of the house (Bhava) concerned.

41



Please refer to Jataka Padhati by Bhu Deva for determining the quantums of 

malefic  and  benefic  aspects.  Keshavi  Jataka  and  Sripati  Padhati  will  also  be 

helpful.

Now we come to Shri Mantreswara's views on this subject as given in the 

following verses in Chapter 4 of Phaladeepika.

1. A planet is said to possess six kinds of strength which are in the following 

order —

(1) Kalay or temporal.

(2) Chesta Bala or motional strength.

(3) Uchcha or that derived from its exaltation position.

(4) Dik or directional strength

(5) Ayana or that derived from declination (north or south).

(6) Sthana Bala or positional strength.

Mars,  the Moon and Venus are strong during the  night  time. Mercury is 

strong all the 24 hours. The rest viz., the Sun, Jupiter and Saturn are strong during 

the day time.

The benefics are strong during the bright half of the month (Shukla Paksha) 

and the malefics are strong during the dark half of the month (Krishna Paksha).

Planets when they are lords of the year, month, day and house get 1/4, 1/2, 

3/4, and 1 Rupa of strength respectively. 

2. The Moon gets Chesta Bala when it is full. The Sun gets this strength 

when he is on the northern course. The other planets get Chesta Bala when they are 

in retrograde motion.

The planets are victorious in the planetary course when they are in the north 

and are not combust. A planet is said to possess full Uchcha Bala when he is in 

deep exaltation position.

As  regards  directional  strength  or  Dik  Bala  the  Sun  and  Mars  get  this 

strength  when they  are  in  the  10th  house.  Mercury  and Jupiter  get  directional 

strength when they are in the 1st house (Lagna), Saturn gets this strength in the 7th 

house and the Moon and Venus in the 4th house.

42



Mercury,  Saturn  and  the  Moon  get  Ayana  bala  when  they  are  on  the 

Southern course. The rest are vested with Ayana bala when they are on the northern 

course.

3. A planet gets Sthana Bala (positional strength) according to position in his 

sign of exaltation, in his own sign, in his friend's sign or in the six vargas.

A planet obtains one Rupa of strength in a Kendra, 1/2 Rupa in a Panaphara 

house and 1/4 in an Apoklima house.

The hemaphrodite planets are strong in the middle of the sign (11° to 20°), 

male planets in the first part of a sign (1° to 10°) and female in the last part of the 

sign (21° to -30°).

Saturn, Mars, Mercury, Jupiter, Venus, the Moon and the Sun are in their 

natural  or inherent strength (Nalsarglk Bala).  This means Mars is stronger than 

Saturn, Mercury is stronger than Mars, Jupiter is stronger than Mercury, Venus is 

stronger than Jupiter; the Moon is stronger than Venus and the Sun is stronger than 

the  Moon.  The  Sun is  the  strongest  and the  Saturn  is  the  weakest  in  inherent 

strength or Naisargik Bala.

4. Even if a planet be in his sign of debilitation or debilitated Navamsa, he is 

vested with full strength if he is retrograde and if his rays are full and brilliant.

Like the Moon, a planet will be treated as weak if his rays are eclipsed (on 

account  of  being near  the  Sun)  even though he may be posited  in  his  sign of 

exaltation, in his own or a friend's sign or Navamsa. This means that even if the 

Moon be in Taurus or Cancer, if she is very near or with the Sun, she will be 

considered weak. A debilitated Moon when she is full (on Pooran masi night) will 

be treated as strong. This principle applies to other planets also.

5. All planets are strong when they are posited in their sign of exaltation. 

The Moon is strong and auspicious when she has her full Paksha Bala. The Sun has 

his full Dik Bala when he is in the 10th house. The other five non-luminous planets 

are strong when they are retrograde.

Rahu is strong in Cancer, Taurus, Aries, Aquarius and Scorpio and Ketu is 

strong in Pisces, Virgo, Taurus and the latter half of Sagittarius and in Partvesha 

43



and Indrachapa when the Sun and the Moon are together in the same sign.

Notes. It will be useful to know at this stage now the position of Partvesha 

and Indrachapa is worked out.

(1)  Add 4 Rasis  13 degrees and 20 minutes  to  the longitude of  the  Sun 

(Surya) Spasta. The result will be Dhooma.

(2) By deducting 12 Rasis from Dhooma we get Vyatipata.

(3) Add 6 Rasis to the longitude of Vyatipata, we will get Partvesha.

(4)  By deducting  12  Rasis  from the  longitude of  Parivesha,  we will  get 

Indrachapa.

For example at birth the Sun's longitude is 7-26°-ll'-38". (1) Longitude of the 

Sun

7-26-11-38
+ 4-13-20 
Dhooma 0-9-31-38
(-) 12-0-0-0

0-9-31-38 
Vyatipata 11-20-28-22
(-) 11-20-28-32

6-0-0-0 
Partvesha 5-20-28-22
(-) 12-0-0-0

5-20-28-22 
Indrachapa 6-9-31-38 

6. The first house gets one Rupa of strength if it is a triped sign. If it be 

Vrischika it gets 1 /4 Rupa as its strength. In any other sign the strength will be 1/2 

Rupa.

The strength of the Ascendant (Lagna) is equal to that of its Lord and is very 

powerful when the lord occupies an Upachaya house (3, 6, 10, 11). It is also very 

powerful when it .is aspected by its lord Jupiter or Mercury or when it is occupied 

by Venus and is at the same time without the conjunction or aspect of any other 

planet.

The day signs are strong in births during day time and the night signs in 

birth during night time.

44



7. If  a  planet  is  in his sign of exaltation he gets one Rupa of  positional 

strength (Sthana Bala). He gets 3/4 of this strength in his Moolatrikona Rasi, 1/2 

Rupa in his own sign and 1/4 Rupa in his friend's sign. He gets very little strength 

when  he  is  in  his  enemy's  sign.  If  a  planet  is  in  his  sign  of  depression  or  is 

combust, he gets no positional strength at all.

8. The planets are vested with full positional strength in the Ascendant (first 

house), 3/4th strength in the 7th house, 1/2 in the 10th house and 1/4 in the 4th 

house. This is how a distinction has been drawn by the astrologers amongst the 

four kendras.

9. The aspect from the 7th house is the only one that should be considered as 

most  effective  in  all  cases.  But  some learneds are  of  the view that  the  special 

aspects of Jupiter (to the 5th and the 9th), of Mars (to the 4th and the 8th) and of 

Saturn (to the 3rd and the 10th) are equally competent in producing effects in all 

Yogas and the like.

10. The Naisargik or natural friendship and enmity etc. of the planets is more 

fully effective and preferable to their corresponding Tatkalik or temporal ones as 

the latter is only of changing nature and not of permanent one.

11. In warding off evil and in promoting auspicious effects Jupiter is the 

most  powerful  of  all  planets.  Venus possesses half  of  the  auspicious effects  of 

Jupiter and Mercury possesses only half of that of Venus. But the Moon's strength 

is the foundation of the strength of all the planets.

Chandrakriya etc.

Now we will be demonstrating the method to work Chandrakriya, Chandra 

Avastha and Chandravelas specify their effects. In the assessment of a birth chart, 

query chart and for Muhurta, full consideration should be given to Chandrakriya, 

Chandra  Avastha  and Chandravelas.  Chandrakriyas  are  60  in  number,  Chandra 

Avasthas 12 and Chandravelas 36.

12.  Note  the  Nakshatra  at  birth,  query  or  Muhurta.  The  Ghatikas  and 

Vighatikas which have elapsed may be converted into Vighatikas.

Divide  this  result  by  (1)  60,  (2)  300  and  (3)  100.  The  three  resulting 

45



quotients are named (1) Chandrakriya, (2) chandra Avastha and (3) Chandravela 

respectively. Their effects are described below.

Notes:  Now  we  give  below  ready  made  tables  for  finding  out  the 

Chandrakriyas, Chandra avasthas and Chandravelas.

Chandrakriya

60 parts of a Nakshatra to find out Chandrakriya

The stretch of a Nakshatra is  13°-20'.  One sixtieth part  of which will  be 

13'-20"

 D M S  D M S  D M S  D M S 
(1) 0-13-20 (16) 3-33-20 (31) 6-53-20 (46) 10-13-20 
(2) 0-26-40 (17) 3-46-40 (32) 7-6-40 (47) 10-26-40 
(3) 0-40-0 (18) 4-0-0 (33) 7-20-0 (48) 10-40-0 
(4) 0-53-20 (19) 4-13-20 (34) 7-33-20 (49) 10-53-20 
(5) 1-6-40 (20) 4-26-40 (35) 7-46-40 (50) 11-6-40 

47



(6) 1-20-0 (21) 4-40-0 (36) 8-0-0 (51) 11-20-0 
(7) 1-33-20 (22) 4-53-20 (37) 8-13-20 (52) 11-33-20 
(8) 1-46-40 (23) 5-6-40 (38) 8-26-40 (53) 11-46-40 
(9) 2-0-0 (24) 5-20-0 (39) 8-40-0 (54) 12-0-0 
(10) 2-13-20 (25) 5-33-20 (40) 8-53-20 (55) 12-13-20 
(11) 2-26-40 (26) 5-46-40 (41) 9-6-40 (56) 12-26-40 
(12) 2-40-0 (27) 6-0-0 (42) 9-20-0 (57) 12-40-0 
(13) 2-53-20 (28) 6-13-20 (43) 9-33-20 (58) 12-53-20 
(14) 3-6-40 (29) 6-26-40 (44) 9-46-40 (59) 13-6-40 
(15) 3-20-0 (30) 6-40-0 (45) 10-0-0 (60) 13-20-0 

For example in a nativity the longitude of the Moon (Chandraspasta) is 11-

20-37-21 and the stretch of Revti Nakshatra being from 11-16-40 to 12-0-0:

Longitude of the Moon 11-20-37

Commencement of Revti 11-16-40

Elapsed portion of Revti 3-57-21

By referring to the above table we will find that the 17th part ended at 3-46-

40 and the 18th part will end at 4-0-0. Therefore by the elapsing of 17th part the 

effect of its Chandrakriya viz one. Who studies vedas' will be taken into account 

which means that the native will be a learned person.

Chandra Avastha

For finding out Chandra Avastha the stretch of a Nakshatra has to be divided 

into 12 parts. Thus one part will come to 1-6-40.

 D M S  D M S  D M S 
(1) 1-6-40 (5) 5-33-20 (9) 10-0- 0 

(2) 2-13-20 (6) 6-40-0 (10) 11-6- 40 
(3) 3-20-0 (7) 7-46-40 (11) 12-13-20 
(4) 4-26-40 (8) 8-53-20 (12) 13-20- 0 

For example the elapsed portion of Revti Nakshatra Is 3°-57'-21". The third 

part ends at 3°-20-0 The 4th part will end at 4°-26'-40". Therefore the effect of 4th 

part will be taken into account which is 'distinguished for becoming a ruler'.

Chandravela

48



For finding out the Chandravela the stretch of a Nakshatra viz 13°-20' has to 

be divided into 36 parts. One part will thus come to 13'-13"-20"

 DMS  DMS  DMS 
(1) 0-22-13-20 (13) 4-48-53-20 (25) 9- 15-33-20 
(2) 0-44-26-40 (14) 5-11-6-40 (26) 9-37-46-40 
(3) 1-6-40- 0 (15) 5-13-20-0 (27) 10-0-0-0 
(4) 1-28-53-20 (16) 5-55-13-20 (28) 10-22-13-20 
(5) 1-57-6-40 (17) 6-17-46-40 (29) 10-49-26-40 
(6) 2-13-20- 0 (18) 6-40-0- 0 (30) 11-6-40-0 
(7) 2-35-33-20 (19) 6-2-13-20 (31) 11-28-53-20 
(8) 2-57-46-40 (20) 7-24-26-40 (32) 11-51-6-40 
(9) 3-20-0-0 (21) 7- 46-40- 0 (33) 12-13-20-0 
(10) 3-42-13-20 (22) 8-8-53-20 (34) 12-35-33-20 
(11) 4-4-26-40 (23) 8-31-6-40 (35) 12-57-46-40 
(12) 4-26-40-0 (24) 8-53-20-0 (36) 13-20-0-0 

For example if the elapsed portion of Revati Nakshatra is 3°-57'-21". Part 10 

ends 3°-42'-13"-20". Part 11 ends 4°-4'-26"-40". Therefore it falls in 11th part. The 

effects of this 'taking poison' which means the nature is fed up with life and wants 

to get rid of it.

20. The Chandrakriya, Chandra Avastha and Chandravela described above 

will be found very useful and effective in the case of a birth, muhurta and a quary. 

One  ought  therefore  to  pay  particular  attention  to  them  before  making  any 

prediction.

21. Paksha Bala (fortnightly strength) is of special importance to the Moon 

and Sthana Bala is of some importance to the other planets. When this strength 

added to other kinds of strength of a planet, it will add more strength to that planet. 

There are many such types of strength.

Number of Bala Pinda

22. The Sun is said to be strong where he obtains 6.5 Rupas of strength. The 

Moon is strong with 6 Rupas, Mars with 5 Rupas, Mercury with 7 Rupas, Jupiter 

with 8.5 Rupas, Venus with 5.5 Rupas.

23. Saturn is declared strong with 5 Rupas of strength. If Shadbala Pinda of 

49



planet be less than the strength number given above, he will be considered weak. 

In this  manner the strength of each planet  should be taken into account before 

making prediction.

Notes: It has already been indicated above what should be the strength of a 

planet under Shad Bala scheme, to be declared strong. Now we consider it useful 

to describe the views of other authorities as to when he should be declared strong 

on the basis of the five kinds of strength viz. (1) Sthan Bala, (2) Dik Bala, (3) 

Chesta Bala, (4) Kala Bala and (5) Ayana Bala. We have not mentioned Naisargika 

Bala because it is always the same in every birth chart. The following table shows 

how much strength is required for the various planets to be declared strong:

Planet Sthan Dik Chesta Kala Ayana Total 
 RS RS RS RS RS RS 
Sun 2-45 0-35 0-50 1-52 0-30 6-32 
Moon 2-13 0-50 0-30 1-40 0-40 5-53 
Mars 1-16 0-30 0-40 1-7 0-20 4-13 
Mercury 2-45 0-35 0-50 1-52 0-30 6-32 
Jupiter 2-45 0-35 0-50 1-52 0-30 6-32 
Venus 2-13 0-50 0-30 1-40 0-40 5-53 
Saturn 1-36 0-30 0-40 1-7 0-20 4-13 

24. To ascertain the strength of the Lagna and other house add one Rupa to 

the strength of the lord of the Bhava concerned. Further add to them the Dik Bala 

and Drig Bala of that house. The sum total would be the Bhava Bala required.

Notes: If the Bhava is aspected or associated with its lord, Jupiter. Venus or 

Mercury or be aspected by Jupiter or Mercury, the strength so obtained should also 

be taken into account in determining the strength of a house (See verse 6 of this 

Chapter).

Thus ends  the  fourth  chapter  on  "Determination  of  Shadabalas"  in  

Phaladeeplka composed by Mantreswara.

Chapter 5

Source of livelihood

1. Which planet helps to acquire wealth? Which planet is in the 10th to the 

Lagna or Moon whoever is stronger? The source of acquisition of wealth will be 

father if the planet be the Sun. mother if the planet be the Moon, an enemy in case 

of Mars, a friend in case of Mercury, a brother in case of Jupiter, a wife in case of 

Venus and a servant in case of Saturn.

The profession of the native will be that assigned to the lord of the Navamsa 

occupied by the lord of the 10th house from the Lagna, from the Moon and the Sun 

(severally) whoever is the strongest.

Notes — It will be seen in the verse that the source of acquisition of wealth 

has been limited to relations and some other persons. In ancient times when this 

work  was  written,  the  sources  of  income  were  limited.  In  modern  times  the 

situation is quite different.  For example, it  is stated that in case of the Sun the 

accrual  of  wealth  could  be  from  father.  No  doubt,  the  Sun  governs  and  is 

significator  should  be  taken  into  consideration  for  determining  the  source  of 

income. The same could apply to other planets. For example, if there be a strong 

Moon in the 10th from the lagna. the income can be predicted from white coloured 

articles (milk, pearls, silk, white clothes etc.), from articles coming out of water, 

from silver, from business with foreign lands etc.

For the other part of the verse we will try to explain its meaning through a 

chart.

The Lagna is Leo. The Sun is in Scorpio. The Moon is in Pisces. Taurus is 

the sign 10th to the Lagna. Suppose the lord of this house Venus is in Libra 5 

degrees. Then Venus would be in Scorpio Navamsas in Libra.  The Navamsa of 

Scorpio  falls  between  3°-30'  to  6°-40'.  The  lord  of  Scorpio  Navamsa is  Mars. 

Therefore, we will take that the source of livelihood (profession) would be in any 

of the significations of Mars.

51



Moon

Lag.

Sun Merc. Jup.

If the Sun be the strongest Leo will be the 10th sign and its lord is the Sun. 

Suppose  the  Sun  is  in  Scorpio-26  degrees,  he  will  be  in  Aquarius  navamsa 

(because Aquarius Navamsa falls in 23°-20' to 26°-40' of Aquarius). Saturn will, 

thus, be the lord of the Navamsa of the Sun. Therefore the sources of livelihood 

will be in accordance with any of the characteristics and significations of Saturn.

If the Moon be stronger than the Lagna and the Sun, Sagittarius will be the 

sign 10th to the Moon whose lord is Jupiter. If Jupiter is in 15 degrees of Virgo, he 

will be in Taurus Navamsa (because in Virgo, Taurus Navamsa falls in 13°-20' to 

16°-40'). The lord of this Navamsa is Venus. Therefore, the sources of livelihood 

will be in accordance with the characteristics and significations of Venus.

A question  arises  why  should  only  the  lord  of  the  10th  house  from the 

Lagna, the Sun and the Moon Whoever be the strongest, should be considered and 

why not assessment should be made from all the three Vis., the lord of the Lagna, 

lord of the Moon sign and the lord of the Sun sign. Many learneds are of the view 

that equal importance should be given to all the three lords because there are some 

who have only one source of income while others have varied sources of income.

2. The sources of livelihood of the native will be through fruit bearing trees, 

by the recitation of mantras, by fraud and cunningness, by gambling, by speaking 

lies,  through  wool,  medicines  and  the  like,  by  working  on  metals  or  through 

service under a king or respectable person, if the lord of the 10th house be placed 
52



in the Navamsa of the Sun.

3.  The  sources  of  income or  livelihood  will  be  through  trade  in  water-

products (pearls, corals etc.),  agriculture and cattle breeding, pilgrimage to holy 

places, service under a woman and trade in drapery. If the Navamsa occupied by 

the lord of the 10th house is that of the Moon.

4. The sources of income or livelihood will be through metals, serving for 

fighting  battles,  cooking,  lands,  gold,  causing  troubles  to  others,  weapons, 

adventure, association with wicked men, spying or through theft if the lord of the 

10th house occupies the Navamsa of Mars.

5. In a nativity where the lord of the 10th house is posited in the Navamsa 

owned by Mercury, the earning will  be through composition of poem, study of 

sacred scripture,  by being a  writer,  or  through clerical  work or  through tricks, 

through the knowledge of astrology, through the study of Vedas, by recitation of 

Mantras, through priesthood or by some pretext.

6. If the Navamsa be that of Jupiter, the sources of livelihood or earning will 

be through dependence on Brahmins, or through dependence on temples (serving 

as  priests  etc.)  or  religious  Ashramas,  through  the  beneficience  of  the  king 

(Government), through study of Puranas, Shastras, or Vedas, through practicing of 

righteous paths and actions, or by religious instruction.

7. If the Navamsa be that of Venus, the sources of earning will be through 

dependence, serving a woman (she may be wife, prostitute, queen, a film actress or 

any  other  woman),  through  cows,  buffaloes,  elephants,  horses,  etc.,  through 

teaching music or through musical performances, by singing or dancing, through 

silver (sale and purchase), scents, milk, curd etc., ornaments, through silken and 

other expensive dress materials, by being a companion or aides of a lady of high 

standing, or by his poetic talents.

8. If the Navamsa be that of Saturn, the sources of income or livelihood, will 

be through dealing in roots and fruits, by hard physical labour, through servants or 

menials, rogues and through the earnings of men of low morality, through grains of 

bad  quality,  by  carrying  loads,  by  following  low kind  of  professions,  through 

53



sculpture, wooden materials, and by serving under a butcher.

9. If the lord of Navamsa be strong, there will be accrual of wealth without 

any obstacle or exertion. If it be weak, very little earning may be expected. The 

country from which the accrual of wealth will be Indicated by the sign representing 

the 10th house or the Navamsa occupied by the lord of the 10th house. If the sign 

be occupied or aspected by its lord, the source of income will be found in his own 

country. The same will happen when the Navamsa occupied by the lord of the 10th 

house by a fixed sign. If the sign of the 10th house be occupied or aspected by 

planet other than its lord, the person concerned will earn in the place other than his 

native land.

Thus ends the fifth chapter an "Profession & Livelihood" in Phaladeepika  

composed by Mantreswara.

Chapter 6

YOGAS

1. If Mars occupies Aries or Scorpio (his own signs), or Capricorn (his sign 

of exaltation), identical with a kendra, the yoga so formed is known as Ruchaka.

If Mercury occupies Gemini (his own sign) or Virgo (his sign of exaltation) 

identical with a kendra, the Yoga so formed is called Bhadra Yoga.

If Jupiter occupies Sagittarius or Pisces (his own sign) or Cancer (his sign of 

exaltation)  identical  with a kendra,  the Yoga arising from such a disposition is 

known as Hamsa Yoga.

If  Venus  occupies  Taurus  or  Libra  (his  own sign)  or  Pisces  (his  sign of 

exaltation) identical with a kendra, the Yoga so formed is called Malavya Yoga.

If Saturn occupies Capricorn or Aquarius (his own sign) or Libra (his sign of 

exaltation), the Yoga so formed is known as Sasa Yoga.

Nates - These five Yogas have been named as Pancha Mahapurusha Yogas. 

Jataka Parijata has defined these Yogas as under :-

"According  as  Mars,  Mercury,  Jupiter,  Venus  or  Saturn  possessing  the 

greatest  strength  and  occupying  a  kendra  is  in  Moolatrikona,  Swakshetra  or 

Swochcha,  the  resulting  Rajayogas  will  be  named  Ruchaka,  Bhadra,  Hamsa, 

Malavya and Sasa the beautiful"

According to Saravali "Venus, Mars, Saturn, Jupiter and Mercury remaining 

in  their  respective  own houses  or  exaltation  signs,  identical  with  kendra  cause 

Malavya, Ruchaka, Sasa, Hamsa and Bhadra Yogas respectively"

But it is imperative that Yogas will give the promised effects only when the 

Lagna or the Moon and the Yoga forming planets are without blemish. In other 

words they are vested with strength and are not associated with or in conjunction 

with malefics, are not combust and not placed between malefics.

As the names of Yogas denote the presons with such Yogas at birth become 

Mahapurushas or  illustrious  persons.  We have also found that  the  many of  the 

noted politicians and administrators had one or more of such yogas present in their 

55



birth charts, some illustrative birth charts are given below :

2. The person born in Ruchaka Yoga has a long face. He acquires wealth by 

performing courageous deeds. He will be full of valour and powerful, will conquer 

his enemies and will be arrogant. He will become famous by virtue of merits and 

will be commander of an army and will be successful in all his ventures.

The  person  with  Bhadra  Yoga  at  birth  will  be  longlived.  He  will  be 

intelligent,  will  be  clean  (pure  thoughts  and  clean  body),  praised  by  learned 

persons, very rich and prosperous and eloquent in his speeches.

3. The person born with Hamsa Yoga at birth, will be a king, a high political 

or gvernment dignitary respected by good people. He will have in his hands and 

feet marks of Conch, Lotus, Fish and Ankusha. His body will be beautiful, will eat 

delicious food and will be virtuous.

The person born in MaJavya Yoga will have strong limbs, will be very rich, 

blessed with wife and children and good fortune. He will be prosperous, will enjoy 

pleasures of life, will possess good vehicles and become renowned and learned. He 

will have imperturbed senses.

4. The person with Sasa Yoga at birth will be acclaimed by all, have good 

servants, will be strong, will be the head of a village or a king. He will be wicked 

by nature and will associate with women not his own. He will be inclined to use 
56



other's wealth and will be happy.

These five yogas reckoned from the Lagna as well as from the Moon and 

will be found effective from both the places. They bestow on the native an empire 

and perfection. The person with one such yoga will be fortunate, with two such 

yogas will be equal to a king, with three he will be a king, four such yogas will 

make  him a  sovereign  of  sovereigns  (Emperor)  and  with  five  such  yogas  the 

person will be superior to an Emperor.

5. Three yogas, viz, Sunapha, Anapha and Durudhara are formed when the 

57



planets occupy the 2nd and 12th houses reckoned from the Moon. There will be 

Kemadruma yoga if the above three Yogas are absent. Some learneds are of the 

opinion that there will be Kemadruma Yoga if (1) When a Kendra or the Moon is 

associated with a planet (2) When there is a planet in a Kendra from the Moon.

Notes — According to Saravali Kemadruma Yoga is formed if at least one of 

the said three yogas (viz., Sunapha, Anapha and Durudhara) is not present or if the 

Moon's angles (Kendras) are devoid of angles or if she is unaspected by all the 

planets. Such yoga causes extreme difficulties.

According to Hora Sara (an ancient treatise on Astrology by Prithuyasas) the 

Anapha,  Sunapha and Durudhara Yogas will  not  put  to effect  if  the Moon's or 

Lagna's  angles  are  not  occupied.  In  such  case,  the  Yoga  arising  is  called 

Kemadruma which makes even a king beg. To explain this further it may be said 

that for obtaining Kemadruma, the Moon should not have a planet on either side or 

with  it.  The  Sun's  presence  and  of  course  that  of  nodes,  will  not  nullify  the 

Kemadruma Yoga. But if there is a planet in any of the Moon angles or from the 

angles of Lagna, or if the Moon herself angular to the Lagna, the Kemadruma Yoga 

does not exist.

There are other kinds of Kemadruma Yogas mentioned in Jataka Parijata 

which are as follows :-

(1) The Moon in Lagna or the 7th but not aspected by Jupiter.

(2) All the planets devoid of strength and less Bindus in Ashtakavarga.

(3) The Moon in case of a night birth if in fall or in enemy's Rasi/Navamsa 

and aspected by the 10th lord.

(4) The Moon in Scorpio Navamsa joining a malefic and aspected by Lagna 

lord.

(5) The waning Moon in Neecha Rasi for a night birth. As regards Anapha, 

Sunapha and Durudhara Yogas according to Saravali by all possible permutations 

and transmutations, one can see 30 kinds of Sunapha yoga, 30 kinds of Anapha and 

180 kinds of Durudhara yogas. For details please consult English translation and 

commentary of Saravali published by Ranjan Publications.

6. The person with Sunapha Yoga at birth will be a monarch or his equal 

with self acquired property and respected and renounced for his intellectual ability 

and riches. The person born with Anapha Yoga will be powerful, will enjoy good 

health  and  will  have  sweet  temperament.  He  will  be  famous  and  all  worldly 

comforts will be available to him. He will be well dressed contented and happy.

7. The native with Durudhara Yoga will enjoy all comforts of life as may 

become available to a ruler and will own abundant wealth and vehicles. He will be 
59



generous and will be attended to by faithful servants.

One born under Kemadruma Yoga even if he belongs to a royal family, will 

become unknown and will lead a miserable life. He will be addicted to immoral 

ways, will face poverty, will be a menial and will be wickedly disposed.

8. If benefic planets other than the Moon (and the nodes) are posited in the 

2nd, the 12th and both the Bhavas from the Sun, the Yogas so formed are known as 

Subhavesi,  Subhavasi  and  Subhobhayachari  respectively.  But  if  the  planets 

forming the Yogas are malefics, the yogas so formed are called Papavesi, Papavasi, 

and Papobhayachari respectively.

When the 12th and 2nd from the Lagna are occupied by benefics, the Yoga 

so formed is  called Subhakartari.  If  these houses are occupied by malefics  the 

resultant yoga is called Papakartari.

If benefics without being aspected by malefics occupy the 2nd house from 

the Lagna, the Yoga so arising is known as Susubha.

Notes  —  In  most  of  the  authoritative  works  of  Hindu  Astrology 

differendation  lias  been  made  between  malefics  and  benefics  in  forming 

Subhavesi, Subhavasi and Subhobhayachari Yogas. According to them —

(1) The yoga is called Subhavesi if amongst Mars, Mercury, Jupiter, Venus 

and Saturn, any of them is in the 2nd to the Sun.

(2) The Yoga is known as Subhavasi if any amongst the planets mentioned 

above is in the 12th to the Sun.

(3) If any or more of the above planets are in the 2nd and 12th the Yoga is 

known as Ubhayachari Yoga.

But as will be seen from verse 8, Shri Mantreswara has made a definite and 

clear  distinction  between  the  Yogas  formed  by  benefics  and  those  formed  by 

malefics. We feel that Mantreswara's views are very logical and therefore correct.

9.  The  person  with  Subhavesi  Yoga  at  birth  will  be  very  good  looking, 

happy, meritorious, valiant, a king and virtuous. The person with Subhavasi Yoga 

will be renowned, dear to all, and very rich and prosperous. He will be governed 

and will be liked by the king. The native having Subhobhayachari Yoga in his birth 

60



chart will have an attractive body, will be soft spoken, will delight the world, will 

be eloquent, renowned and wealthy.

10. The person with Asubhavesi Yoga at birth will unfairly defame others, 

will not be beautiful and will move in the company of low and wicked people. The 

person with Asubhavasi Yoga will be dishonest, harsh and abusive in speech and 

will  associate  with  wicked people.  He will  be  unvirtuous  though he will  have 

knowledge of Shastras and Scriptures. The person born in Asubhobhayachari yoga 

will suffer mentally due to dishonour in public and will be devoid of wealth and 

fortune.

11. Subhakartari Yoga at birth will make a person longlived, fearless, healthy 

and without enemies. Papakartari Yoga will make the person miserable, bereft of 

wife and children. He will have defective limbs and will have a short life.

Notes  —  Saravali  which  makes  no  differences  between  Subhavesi  and 

Subhavasi  and Asubhavesi  and Asubhavasi Yogas has given effects of different 

planets  forming  Vesi  and  Vasi  and  Ubhayachari  Yogas.  According  to  Saravali 

should Jupiter cause Vesi Yoga, the native will accumulate money, be learned and 

be good-treated. If Venus produces this yoga, the person will be timid, will face 

obstacles  in  his  missions,  will  have  pleasant  (swift)  movements  and  will  be 

defeated. Mercury's participation Indicates that native will be a servant, will suffer 

penury, be soft-spoken and be modest. He will be bashful. Mars denotes that native 

will resort to base means but will be helpful to others. If it is Saturn that causes 

vesi yoga, one will join others' wives, will be wicked, will resemble an old person 

in appearence,  will  be fraudulent  in disposition and be contemptuous.  He will, 

however, have wealth.

If Jupiter should cause vasi yoga, the native will possess courage, strength 

and wisdom.  He keeps  up  his  word.  In  the  case  of  Venus,  the  person will  be 

valorous, famous, virtuous and reputed. Mercury emanating this Yoga will make 

one speak sweetly. He will be beautiful and will obey other's orders. The Vasi Yoga 

caused by Mars indicates that the subject will be victorious in war, will be famous 

and  will  own  fortunes.  If  the  Yoga  is  caused  by  Saturn,  the  native  will  be 

61



businessman, wicked, will steel others' money, will hate elders and will be husband 

of a pious woman.

12. The person born with Amala Yoga at birth will be virtuous, will have 

faith in religion, will be happy, fortunate, will be honoured by the king, have an 

amiable nature and will always have a smile on his face.

Notes — Amala Yoga is formed when there is a benefic planet in the 10th. 

house from the Lagna or the Moon.

13. The effects of Susubha, Subha Kartari and Subha Vest and other Yogas 

would be the same as they are caused by benefics in case of Suhapha and other 

Yogas. The reverse would be the effects in case of Asubha, Papakartari and other 

Yogas caused by malefics.

14. Mahabhagya Yoga is caused In the case of a male if the birth is during 

the day (between sunrise and sunset). If the Ascendant, the Sun and the Moon are 

In odd signs (viz., Aries, Gemini, Leo. Libra, Sagittarius, and Aquarius).

Mahabhagya Yoga will arise in the case of a female if the birth is during the 

night time (after sunset and before sunrise) when the Ascendant, the Sun and the 

Moon  are  in  even  signs  (viz.,  Taurus,  Cancer,  Virgo,  Scorpio.  Capricorn  and 

Pisces). In this connection see the horoscope of Indira Gandhi who was born at 

night.

Kesari Yoga is caused when in a birth chart the Moon is in a Kendra position 

to Jupiter.

The Moon in the 12th, 8th or 6th house from Jupiter causes Sakata Yoga. 

The  Sakata  Yoga  is  cancelled  if  the  Moon  be  in  a  Kendra  position  from the 

Ascendant (lagna).

The  Adhama,  Sama and Varishtha  Yogas  are  formed  when  the  Moon is 

respectvely in a Kendra, a Panaphara and an Apoklima house reckoned from the 

Sun.

15. The person with Mahabhagya Yoga will be immensely popular In the 

public,  will  be  very  generous  in  giving  gifts  and  will  possess  a  very  high 

reputation. He will be a ruler of the earth, will have a life span of 80 years and will 

be  of  spotless  character.  A female  born  with  this  Yoga  will  be  exceedingly 

fortunate and possess sweet manners.

Notes — In the case of Shrimati Indira Gandhi whose horoscope we have 

given above, all the above effects were experienced by her in her life time except 

that  her  husband  was  longlived.  That  was  due  to  other  adverse  planetary 

dispositions in her horoscope.

16. The person with Kesari Yoga will destroy his enemies like a lion. He will 

address assembly with wisdom and in a noble manner. He will be passionate and 

emotional  in  his  behaviour.  He  will  enjoy  a  long  life  and  will  attain  a  high 

reputation and will be intelligent. He will achieve every thing by his own valour.

17. The person with Sakata Yoga at birth will be unhappy and unfortunate. 

He will be unable to achieve any fame and will lead an ordinary life. Sometimes 

his luck dawns and at other times it fades away.

This is the horoscope of Pt. Jawahar Lal Nehru. There is Sakata Yoga as the 
63



Moon is in the 6th house from Jupiter but Sakata Yoga gets concelled as the Moon 

is in a Kendra from the Lagna (in the Lagna itself).

vehicles, will achieve fame, will enjoy happiness, will acquire knowledge and will 

have intellectual equipment, modesty, ability, learning and will be generous. The 

effects will be of a medium nature in Sama Yoga and very little in Adhama Yoga.

19. Vasumati Yoga is formed when all the benefic planets occupy upachaya 

houses (3, 6, 10, 11) from the Lagna or the Moon.

Amala yoga is formed when benefics occupy the 10th house reckoned from 

the Lagna or the Moon.

If the lords of the signs occupied by the Lagna and the Moon be together in a 

Kendra or be in the house of an Adhimitra and a planet endowed with strength 

aspects the Lagna, the planetary disposition so formed is known as Pushkala yoga.

20. The person born with Vasumati yoga will always remain at his house 

(perhaps this means that he will not go out of his native land) and he will be very 

wealthy.

The person born with Amala yoga will possess lands, will be wealthy, will 

be blessed with sons and will be famous, prosperous and wise.

The native of Pushkala yoga will be reverred by kings, will be renowned and 
64



wealthy and will wear expensive clothes and ornaments. He will be fortunate, will 

be a lord of many men and achieve a high status.

21. If all the planets in regular order are in the 5th, 6th and 7th houses, the 

yoga is known as Subnamala. If the planets should occupy the 8th, 6th and 12th 

houses, the yoga will become Asubhamala.

If Venus and the lord of 9th occupy their own or exaltation houses identical 

with Trikona or Kendra, the yoga so formed is called Lakshmi Yoga. If the Moon 

be in his own or exaltation house identical with Kendra or Trikona and be aspected 

by Jupiter, the resulting Yoga is called Gouri Yoga.

22. The person with Sumala Yoga at birth will be an administrator or high 

official, will be reverred by king and will indulge in pleasures of life. He will be 

generous, will be helpful to others and will be devoted to his kinsmen. He will be 

brave and will be blessed with a virtuous wife and sons.

respect to Brahmins, will be unpopular and quarrelsome.

24. The native with Lakshmi Yoga will be constantly engaged in enjoyment 

with a woman of noble temperament. He will be brilliant. He will be capable of 

providing protection to his men and will be a favourite of Goddess Lakshmi (very 

wealthy).  He  will  be  free  from  diseases.  He  will  enjoy  rides  in  beautiful 

palanquines,  horses  or  elephants  (He  will  have  the  privilege  of  travelling  in 

luxurious conveyances). He will be generous in gifts and will be a capable ruler 

favourite of his subjects.

25. The native with Gouri Yoga will have a beautiful body and will be a 

friend of the king. He will possess good qualities and will be blessed with sons. He 

will belong to an illustrious family. His face will be like a lotus. He will be praised

26-27. If Mercury, Jupiter and Venus be in Kendra or Trikona from the lagna 

or be in the 2nd house and Jupiter be in his own sign, friend s sign or in his sign of 

exaltation,  the  planetary  combination  so  formed is  called  Saraswati  yoga.  The 

65



horoscope of Moti Lai Nehru illustrates Saraswati Yoga.

If Venus, the lord of the 9th and Mercury be in similar position, the yoga

If Jupiter, the lord of the 5th and Saturn be similarly disposed, the yoga so 

formed is termed as Virinrhi Yoga.

32. When two lords of different houses mutually interchange places, that is, 

they occupy the house of each other, such a disposition of planets is known as 

Parivartana yoga. The interchanges of the pairs of the bhava lords will number 66 

beginning from the Lagna and ending with the 12th. Out of these 66 parivartana 

Yogas, 30 are caused by the lords of the 6th, 8th and 12th and are called Dalnya

speak harshly and will not have a stable mind. He will encounter obstacles in all 

his ventures.

The native with Kahala Yoga will occasionally be haughtly and sometimes 

sweet in his speech. There will be occasions when he will be very prosperous and 

then will be driven to poverty, unhappiness and misery.

69



34. Person born with Mahayoga will have the beneficence of the Goddess 

Sri and will be adorned with expensive and beautiful clothes and ornaments. He is 

reverred  and  honoured  by  the  king.  He  will  hold  a  high  position  and  will  be 

rewarded of authority by the king, He will be blessed with sons and fully enjoy

Here is the horoscope of Smt. Indira Gandhi. Here there are interchanges of 

houses: —

(1) The lord of the Lagna is in the 7th and the lord of the 7th is in the Lagna.

(2) The lord of the 2nd is in the 5th and the lord of the 5th is in the 2nd.

(3) The lord of the 11th is in the 6th and the lord of the 6th is in the 11th.

Rahu Sun 
Venus Mercury

(1) and (2) are Maha Yogas and (3) is Dainya Yoga The effects of these 

Yogas were fully realised by the native in her life.

Notes - Here it would be relevant to mention that in khand 4 sloka 22 in 

Uttarakalamrit, the exalted results given for mutual interchange of lords of the 6th, 

8th and 12th houses are quite reverse of the effects given in Phaladeepika. The 

sloka in Uttarakalamrit is as under.

This means that (1) If the lord of the 8th is in the 12th or 6th, (2) if the lord 

of the 6th is in the 8th or 12th. (3) if the lord of the 12th is in the 8th or 6th. (4) the 

three lords may be in the signs of each other or be aspected by each other and (5) if 
70



they are not associated with or aspected by the lords of any other houses (in other 

words they may have nothing to do with the lords of any other houses), the person 

born in such a Yoga will be very prosperous and a king of kings.

This is known as Vipareeta Raja Yoga which means that the planets who 

normally give adverse effect, give excellent results.

However, there is some difference between the Yogas given above and those 

mentioned in Phaladeepika. In Phaladeepika Dainya Yogas (by the lords of the 6th, 

8th and 12th) are caused by interchanges of two planets only amongst the lords of 

the 6th, 8th and 12th, while in Uttarkalamrita the effects are given of the placement 

of the lords of the 6th, 8th and 12th in Dusthanas or of their association with or 

aspect by each other and be unrelated top lords of any other houses.

35. Note in the birth chart where the lord of the Lagna is posited, and where 

the lord of the sign occupied by the lord of Lagna is placed. If the lord of this sign 

is in his sign of exaltation or own identical with kendra or trikona, the Yoga so 

formed is termed as Kahala Yoga See this birth chart as an example.

In this  example horoscope lord of  the Lagna is  Mars.  He is  in Leo (5th 

house) Lord of 5th house (Leo) the Sun is in the 1 It in Aquarius. Saturn, the lore, 

of Aquarius, is in 7th a kendra, in his own sign of exaltation. This is how Kahala 

Yoga is formed.
71



If the lord of the sign in which the Lord of Lagna is posited, be in his sign of 

exaltation,  of own sign identical  with kendra or trikona,  the Yoga so arising is 

known as Parvata Yoga.

In  this  example  horoscope  the  lord  of  the  Lagna.  Mars  is  posited  in 

Sagittarius (9th house). Lord of the 9th house Jupiter is in the 4th (a Kendra) in his 

sign of exaltation causing Parvata Yoga.

36. The  person  with  Kahala  Yoga  at  birth  will  be  prosperous,  noble, 

benevolent, kind and propitious. He will be very popular in the public.

The person born with Parvata Yoga will always be wealthy and happy. He 

Will perfrom acts which will afford by lasting benefit to others (like construction 

of Dharmashalas, hospitals, temples, reservoirs, etc.). He will become the ruler of 

the Earth.

The Lord of the Lagna Mercury is in Capricorn (8th House). The Lord of the 8th 

house Saturn is exalted in the 5th causing Parvata Yoga.

37. The conjunction or association of the lords of 9th and the 10th house in 

any auspicious house consitutes Raja Yoga.

If  the  lords  of  a  Kendra  and  Trikona  are  similarly  placed  (that  is,  they 

occupy together an auspicious house), the Yoga so formed is called Shankha Yoga.

38. The person with Raja yoga will be a king or equal to a king. When sets 

out on a journey he will be greeted by bands like Bheri and sounds of Conch etc. 

He  will  have  a  Royal  Umbrella  over  his  head  and  will  be  accompanied  by 

elephants, horses, and palanquins etc. Bards and minstrels will recite poems in his 

praise, He will be presented gifts by eminent persons.

The person born with Shankha Yoga will enjoy all comforts in the company 

of many beautiful women.

39-41 (1) When the seven planets from Sun to Saturn occupy seven separate 

signs the Yoga so arising is known as Vallaki. This is also called Veena Yoga. The 

person  born  in  this  Yoga  is  fond  of  dancing,  singing  and  playing  on  musical 

instrumets and is wealthy.

(2) When all the seven planets are in six signs, they form Dharma Yoga. The 

person born with this Yoga will be generous, a king and benefactor.

to Hasha Yoga. The person born with this Yoga indulges in enjoyment of life, is 

wealthy and of good conduct and has relatives.

(4)  When all  the  seven planets  are  placed  in  four  signs  only,  they  form 

Kendra  Yoga.  The  person  with  this  yoga  at  birth  will  acquire  wealth  and 

agricultural lands.

(5) When all the planets are disposed in three signs only, the resulting yoga 

is known as Shula Yoga. The person with this yoga at birth is wrathful, of violent 

disposition and poor.

Yuga Yoga.  The person with  this  Yoga In  his  birth  chart  will  be heretical  and

The person born with this Yoga will be Indolent, shortlived, without wealth, sinful 

and will associate with low type of persons. Such a person will not be a skillful 

artisan.

Notes— Some authors are of the view that for the Adhiyoga (from the Moon 

or the Lagna) all the three houses viz.,'the 6th, 7th and 8th should be occupied by 

Mercury, Jupiter or Venus. None of them should be vacant but this is not correct. 

Shruti  Kirti  has  pronounced  that  according  to  Vyas  and  other  ancient  sages 

Mercury, Jupiter and Venus may be separately In the three houses or two may be in 

one house and the third may be in any other house (amongst 6,7 and 8) and all the 

three may be together in any of these three houses to meet the requirements of 

these three houses to form this yoga.

43. The further effects of the Adhiyoga are that the native will become lord 

of men, will always be wealthy, will have a large number of kinsmen and whom he 

will feed and will be victorious over his enemies.

44-56. (1) benefics occupy or aspect the Lagna and the lord of Lagna not 

being combust be posited in an auspicious house in his sign of exaltation or own 

sign, the resulting planetary disposition is called Chamara Yoga. The person with 

this yoga at birth grows (progresses) in prosperity like the Moon of the bright half 

of the month and well behaved. He is wealthy, renowned, longlived and lord of 

men.

(2) If the 2nd house is occupied or aspected by benefic planet and the lord of 

2nd house  not  being  combust  is  posited  in  an auspicious  house  in  his  sign of 

exaltation or in his own sign, the resulting Yoga is Dhenu Yoga, the person born 
75



with this yoga will be well equipped with gold, wealth, grains, and precious stones, 

and will be equal to king of kings.

(3) If the third house is occupied or aspected by benefic planets and the lord 

of the third house not being combust,  is  in an auspicious house, in his sign of 

exaltation or in his own sign, the yoga so formed is known as Shaurya yoga.

The person born with Shaurya Yoga has younger brothers devoted to him. 

The younger brothers will attain glory and will be brave and valiant and will be 

endowed with admiration of others. His nature will be adorned like Shri Rama, he 

will be engrossed in state affairs,  will  be loved by everybody and will be very 

renowned.

(4) If the fourth house is similarly disposed the Yoga formed is known as 

Jaladhi. The person born with this Yoga will be rich in cattle wealth and grains. He 

will  own  a  beautifully  constructed  mansion  full  of  relatives.  He  will  have  an 

excellent  wife,  gems, clothes,  ornaments and will  attain a high and respectable 

status.  He  will  be  blessed  with  everlasting  happiness.  He  will  own  elephants, 

horses, palanquins etc., and will be reverred by the king. He will be devoted to 

Brahmins and gods and construct  wells  and reservoirs  by the road side for the 

benefit of others.

(5) Similar disposition of the 5th house gives rise to Chhattra Yoga. The 

person born with Chhattra yoga will lead a very happy family life, will be very 

fortunate and will enjoy happiness from children, will be wealthy and renowned 

with eloquent speech. He will possess a sharp intellect and will become a minister 

of the king. He will be honoured by the king and will be respected by others.

(6) Similar disposition of the 6th house causes Astra yoga. The person born 

with Astra yoga will be capable of conquering very powerful enemies. He will be 

cruel in his disposition and arrogant. He will have bruised limbs but a strong body. 

He will be quarrelsome.

Notes — Normally the 6th house is treated as Dusthana (bad house); but if 

the lord of the sixth be in the sixth, he improves the effects of the 6th house. It is 

generally said by the astrological pandits that malefics do good if they are posited 

76



in the 6th house. The reason for this can be that the 6th house is 'Shatru sthana'. 

Malefics will destroy the enemies. It is also believed that Mars, Saturn and Rahu 

are good in the 3rd, 6th and 11th. The reason for this is also the same, namely, the 

malefic will destroy enemies and diseases. Now we come to Shri Mantreshwarar's 

views. According to him the lord of a house gives good effects when he is vested 

with strength. This is unobjectionable but he has also expressed the opinion that if 

lord of a Dusthana is posited in another dustnana he does good. This has been 

described in Verse 57 of this very chapter. Another thing is that benefics do good to 

the house where they are posited. Similarly the aspect of benefics improves the 

effects of the aspected house.

(7) If there be similar disposition of the 7th house, the Yoga arising is called 

Kama yoga. The person with Kama yoga at birth will have nothing to do with other 

people's wives. His good qualities will enable him to surpass his father and he will 

be very prosperous.

(8) With similar disposition of the 8th house, the yoga-formed is known as 

Astra yoga. The person with this yoga will disturb others in their work and will 

become a talebearer. He will be selfish, poor and have forbidden cravings. He will 

indulge in mean doings and will untimately suffer for his unwanted doings.

(9) The 9th house disposed in the same manner gives rise to Bhagya Yoga. 

The  person  who  has  his  birth  in  the  Bhagya  yoga  will  move  in  palanquins 

(excellent vehicles) in the midst of sounds of musical instruments (bands, drums 

etc.) and with chowries waving to and fro. He will always be equipped with wealth 

and will observe a righteous code of conduct. Gods and Brahmins will be pleased 

with him for his devotion and virtues. He win make his family illustrious and will 

have a lowering disposition.

(10) The disposition in similar manner in the 10th will cause Khyati Yoga. 

The person born with Khayti yoga at his birth will become a king who will protect 

his good subjects by following a code of conduct approved by all. He will have 

sons, friends, wife and will be very wealthy, prosperous and famous.

(11) The disposition in the same way of the 11th will give rise to Parijata 

77



Yoga. The person born with the Parijata Yoga will always be celebrating on some 

account  or  other.  He will  become a king and will  also  be  the  owner  of  much 

hoarded wealth. He will have a large family and will be fond of hearing songs of 

great  people.  He will  be learned and always engaged in performing auspicious 

functions.

(12) The 12th house so disposed will cause Musala Yoga. The person born 

with  Musala  Yoga will  accumulate  wealth  with  great  difficulty.  He will  suffer 

humiliation. His wealth will be tnstable. His expenditure will be only for legitimate 

purposes. He will be stupid and of unsteady mind and he will go to heaven after his 

death.

57. If the lords of the houses from the Lagna onwards are in the 6th, 8th or 

the 12th. or If the houses are occupied or aspected by malefics, 12 kinds of yogas 

are formed from the houses commencing from the Lagna. They are respectively—

(1) Ava Yoga, (2) Nisswa Yoga, (3) Mriti Yoga, (4) Kuhu Yoga, (5) Pamara 

Yoga, (6) Harsha Yoga, (7) Dushkriti Yoga, (8) Sarala Yoga, (9) Nirbhagya Yoga, 

(10) Duryoga,

(11) Daridra Yoga, and (12) VimalaYoga.

58. The person born with Ava yoga will be of no significance (He will be 

unknown and will be of no importance to others). He will be exceedingly poor and 

will  have  a  short  life  (Alpa  ayu).  He  will  suffer  humiliations,  will  remain  in 

company of the wicked and will Be deformed and of ill behaviour. His position 

will remain unsteady.

59. The person with Nisswa yoga at birth will be harsh in speaking. His wife 

will not bear children. He will remain in bad company and will have ill formed 

teeth and eyes. He will be bereft of intelligence, children, learning and power. His 

wealth will be taken away by his enemies.

60. The person with Mriti Yoga will be annihilated by his enemies, will be 

devoid of brothers, shame, strength and wealth. He will get tired by indulging in 

unseemly actions and will be of excitable temperament.

61.  Kuhu  Yoga  will  make  the  native  be  bereft  of  mother,  conveyances, 

78



friends,  happiness,  ornaments,  relations.  He will  be  unemployed and without  a 

place of living having lost the one already owned by him and will have association 

with women of low caste.

62.  Pamara  Yoga  which  affects  the  5th  house,  will  give  the  native  a 

miserable living and he will be indiscriminate. He will be liar and a cheat. He will 

suffer from loss of children or will be childless. He will associate with mean and 

wicked persons. He will have no faith in God or religion and will be a glutton.

63. Harsha Yoga concerns the 6th house. According to this yoga if the lords 

of the 6th,  8th and 12th occupy the 6th house,  the native will  be blessed with 

happiness and good fortune and a strong constitution. He will conquer his enemies 

and will hesitate in indulging in sinful deeds. He will become a friend of illustrious 

and  men  with  class.  He  will  be  wealthy,  splendourous,  famous  and  will  have 

friends and sons.

64. Dushkriti  Yoga involves the 7th house.  The person with this  yoga at 

birth, will be deprived of his own wife and will indulge with other persons' wives. 

He will wander about to and fro unnoticed and will suffer from venereal diseases. 

He will be punished by the king (Government). He will be hated by his relations 

and will remain unhappy in consequence.

65. Sarala Yoga concerns the 8th house. The yoga is formed if the lords of 

the 6th, 8th or 12th are posited in the 8th house. This yoga inspite of the house 

being  a  Dusthana  gives  excellent  results.  The  yoga  enables  the  native  to  be 

longlived. resolute, fearless, prosperous, learned, blessed with children and wealth. 

The native with this yoga will achieve success in all his ventures, will be victorious 

over his enemies and will be a great celebrity.

66.  The  Nirbhagya  Yoga  which  concerns  the  9th  house  (the  house  of 

Bhagya) causes the native to lose all his paternal property such as lands, house etc. 

He will have no regard for good people and elders and will be irreligious. He will 

be dressed in old and worn out clothes, will be poor and miserable.

67.  All  the  physical  efforts  will  prove  fruitless  for  the  person born with 

Duryoga involving the 10th house. He will be of no importance, a traitor and very 

79



selfish only earning to satisfy his own hunger. He will be constantly away from his 

home and live abroad.

68. The yoga involving the 11th house is known as Daridrya Yoga. Incoming 

debts constantly will be the way of life for the person with this yoga. He suffers 

from diseases of the ear. He will be deprived of good brotherhood and will  be 

engaged in cruelly and sins. He will be indecent in speech and work like a menial.

69. The person with his birth in Vlmla Yoga (which concerns the 12th house) 

will be frugal in his expenses and clever in saving money. He will be equipped 

with good behaviour towards others, will enjoy happiness, will  be independent, 

will follow a respectable profession or conduct and will  be well  known for his 

good qualities.

Notes — We would like to make some comments on the three yogas vis., 

Harsha, Sarala and Vimala involving the 6th, 8th, and 12th, the three Dusthanas or 

inauspicious houses of a horoscope. As will be seen irom verses 63, 65 and 69, if 

the lords of these three houses are posited in their own houses or in any of the 

other two houses, they produce excellent results. Every planet In his own house is 

deemed to be good and strong even if the house concerned is 6th, 8th or 12th; but 

how is it  that lord of an inauspicious house produces good resultes when he is 

posited in another inauspicious house. The reason given for such an opposite effect 

is that the lord of an inauspicious when disposed in another inauspicious becomes 

so weak that it loses its evil character and assumes the role of a strong benefic to 

enable him to produce excellent opposite results. Why these three yogas have been 

called  as  Vipareeta  Raja  Yogas?  As  stated  in  our  notes  on  verses  33-35 

Uttarakalamrit  supports  this  view;  but  Parashara  in  his  Brihat  Parashara  Bora 

Shastra  has  accorded  no  recognition  to  this  yoga.  The  effects  given  there  of 

disposition of the lords of the 6th, 8th and 12th in each other's houses are described 

below :-

(1) 6th lord in the 6th - The native will have enmity with the group of his 

kinsmen but. he will be friendly to others and will enjoy mediocre happiness in 

matters like wealth.

80



(2) 6th lord in the 8th - The native will be sickly, inimical, will desire others' 

wealth, be interested in other's wives and be impure (or degraded).

(3) 6th lord in the 12th - The native will always spend on vices, be hostile to 

learned people and will torture living beings.

(4) 8th lord in the 6th - The native will win over his enemies, be afflteted by 

diseases and during childhood, will incure danger through snakes and water.

(5) 8th lord in the 8th - The native will be longlived. If the said planet be 

weak being in the 8th the native's longevity will be medium, he will be a thief, be 

blameworthy and will blame others as well.

(6) 8th lord in the 12th - The native will spend on evil deeds and will have a 

short life. More so, if there be additionally a malefic in the said house.

(7) 12th lord in the 6th - The native will incur enmity with his own men, be 

given to anger, be sinful and, miserable.

(8) 12th lord in 8th - The native will always gain, will speak affably, will 

enjoy a medium span of life and be endowed with qualities.

(9) 12th lord in the 12th - The native will face heavy expenditure, and will 

not have physical felicity, be irritable and spiteful. It will be seen from the above 

that according to Parasara the lords of the 6th, 8th and 12th are not good enough 

even when they occupy their own houses. According to him only the 12th lord in 

the 8th produces some good effects.

Dr. B.V. Raman also has not been kindly to the Harsha, Sarala and Vimala 

yogas  laid  down  by  Shri  Mantreswara.  In  his  book  Three  Hundred  Important 

Combinations while commenting on these three yogas he says boldly, "These three 

yogas furnish us with a clue as to how lords of Dusthanas by occupying another 

Dusthana can overcome the evil due to such malefic ownership. Even though the 

author  of  the  above  yogas  has  ascended  very  pleasant  results  to  these  three 

combinations yet in actual practice, quite contrary have been the results. Parashara 

and Lomasa do not seem to favour the conception that the sting arising from an 

evil  lordship  can  disappear  entirely  as  a  result  of  the  lord  occupying  another 

Dusthana. On the other  hand,  the intensity  will  be somewhat modified.  This is 

81



evident from the fact that according to Parashara, when the 6th lord is in the 6th, 

the native's relatives become enemies while he would be friend of the outsiders; 

and when the 6th lord is in 8th or 12th, the person becomes sick, hates learned 

men,, goes after others' women and takes pleasure in causing violence. Therefore, 

in interpreting the three yogas given above, one should have an eye on the intrinsic 

evil nature of the ownership"

It is also stated in verse 57 of Phala Deepika that Harsha, Sarala and Vimala 

Yogas will also be formed if the 6th, 8th or 12th houses be associated with or 

aspected by malefics. In the context of the general principles of Hindu Astrology, 

we find it difficult to believe that such dispositions or combinations can yield any 

auspicious effects.

We have not found mention of any such yogas In Brihat Jataka, Saravali and 

Jataka Parijata.

70.  If  the lords of  the 6th,  8th and 12th houses vested with strength are 

posited in Kendra or Trikona and the lords of 1st, 10th, 4th and 9th houses be weak 

or combust, and occupy the 6th, 8th and 12th houses, the yoga so arising is named 

Duryoga. If, however, the above dispositions are in the reverse order, viz., the lords 

of the 6th, 8th and 12th houses being weak or combust occupy those houses and 

the lords of the 1st, 4th, 9th and 10th being strong are posited in the kendra or 

trikona  house,  the  native  will  become  a  king,  fortunate,  wealthy,  happy  and 

virtuous.

Thus  ends  the  sixth  chapter  on  "Yogas"  in  Phaladeepika  composed  by  

Mantreswara.

Chapter 7

RAJA YOGAS

1. The native becomes a widely renowned king if at birth he has three or 

more planets in their signs of exaltation or in their own signs posited in a kendra. 

Even one born in an ordinary family becomes a ruler of the earth possessing bands 

of elephants and horses, if five or more planets be posited in a kendra in their signs 

of exaltation or in their own sign*.

2. A person born in a royal family becomes a king if he is not born under any 

Duryoga nor any planets at the time of his birth are eclipsed by the Sun's rays. A 

person born in  a  royal  family  becomes a  king if  in  his  nativity  three  or  more 

planets posited in a kendra are in their signs of exaltation or in their own signs but 

if such a yoga exists in the nativity of a person born in an ordinary family, he 

becomes influended and prosperous like a king. He can also become a king.

3. Even a single planet, even if he be in debilitation, is capable of making a 

person equal  to  a  king,  if  not  being posited in  Dusthana (6th.  8th  or  12th)  or 

combust and be possessed of brilliant rays and be in retrograte motion. If three or 

more planets be so disposed, the native becomes a king. If there are many planets 

posited  in  auspicious  houses  and  Navamsas.  the  native  will  become  a  king 

endowed  with  the  inslgnias  of  royalty  such  as  crown,  umbrella  and  waving 

chowries.

4. The native belonging to royal family becomes victorious every where if at 

his birth two or more planets are endowed with Digbala.

Notes — The Sun and Mars have full Dlgbala in the Bhava madhya of the 

10th house. The Moon and Venus have full Digbala in the Bhava Madhya of the 

4th house. Mercury and Jupiter have full Digbala in the Bhava madhya of the first 

house. Saturn has full Dlgbala in the Bhava madhya of the first house. Saturn has 

lull Digbala in the Bhava madhya of the 7th house.

Should there be five such planets (excepting Saturn) or at least 4 planets 

possessing Digbala, even the person born in an ordinary family, becomes a king.

83



5. When the Lagna and the Moon both be In Vargottama Navamsas and 

when the  Lagna  be  aspected  by  four  planets  other  than  the  Moon,  the  person 

belonging even to a low family becomes a king.

6. Should at birth the lord of the Langa being Vargottama be posited in a 

kendra or Trikona and the lord being Vargottama be posited in a kendra or the 9th 

in his own sign or his sign of exaltation, the native will become a king who will 

occupy  a  beatiful  golden  vehicle  on  the  back  of  an  elephant,  with  chowries 

adorning the two sides.

7. When at birth the Moon is brilliant with white luster and is aspected by 

planet disposed in his own sign or his sign of exaltation, even the person whose 

legitimacy is questionable, will become a king.

When the full Moon is placed in Kendra other than the Lagna the native will 

become a king owning elephants and horses.

8.  When  at  birth  Venus  being  placed  in  Aswini  Nakshatra  occupies  the 

Lagna and is aspected by three planets, the person concerned becomes a powerful 

king capable of overcoming his enemies.

When the lord of Lagna is powerful and occupies the 2nd house with Venus 

in  a  sign which  is  not  his  sign of  depression nor  an enemy's  sign,  the  person 

concerned will become a king.

9. Should Mars be in Aries or Sagittarius identical with the lagna and be 

aspected by a friendly planet, the person concerned becomes a king.

Should the lord of the 9th be in the 10th and vice versa, the person born 

becomes a king who is extolled by all (This is a very powerful Raja Yoga).

10. Should the Sun in conjunction with the Moon be posited in the middle of 

Sagittarius, Saturn be occupying the Lagna and a very powerful Mars be in his sign 

of exaltation,  the native will  become an extremely valourous king who will  be 

offered solutations out of fear by his enemies from a distance.

Notes - It will be relevant to quote here Varahamihir who in his great work 

Brihat Jataka has specified that Saturn is capable of conferring royalty if were to 

rise with the ascendant identical  with Libra,  Sagittarius,  Capricorn,  Aquarius or 

84



Pisces.

11. If the Moon brilliant with disc resembling nectar and lotus stalk in color 

(i.e.  the  full  Moon)  occupies  a  Navamsa  owned  by  the  Sun  and  benefics 

unassociated with malefics occupy kendra, the person born will  become a king 

owning many elephants.

12. Should the Moon be brilliant and as white as milk or conch (i.e. full) and 

three  other  planets  not  being  in  depression  sign  or  vargas  or  inimical  sign  or 

inimical vargas, be in their own Navamsas and be receiving the aspect of benefics, 

the person born becomes lord of the Earth (king) and Vanquishes his enemies.

13. Should the Moon having attained Vargottamsa be aspected by a strong 

planet and no malefic be posited in the Lagna the person will become an emperor 

and possess a well formed body.

14. When Jupiter, Mercury and Venus or the Moon are posited in 9th with 

brilliant  rays  uneclipsed  and  are  also  aspected  by  or  associated  with  friendly 

planets, the person born will become a great king and will be worshipped by his 

subjects like a deity.

15. Should Jupiter and Venus be in Meena, Saturn be exalted, the full Moon 

be aspected by Mars and the Sun be in Aries identical with the Lagna, the native 

concerned will become a king owning a vast army by whose marching so much 

dust is raised that Sun becomes invisible and as a consequence the lotus flowers 

begin to contract under the impression that the Sun has set.

Notes — This verse appears to be somewhat confusing and complicated and 

has led to commentators to interpret it in more than one way. The translation given 

above is that based on the interpretation by Shri V. Subrahmanya Shastri.

According to him this  is  the  only possible  combination the  author  could 

have had in view as otherwise a full Moon in exaltation with the Sun in Aries is an 

impossibility, the Moon to be in exaltation, she should be placed in Taurus. If the 

Sun  were  to  be  in  Aries  the  Moon  cannot  be  full.  In  further  explaining  the 

combination Shri Shastri has said that planetary position as per his translation will 

be as follows:

85



Venus and Jupiter are in Pisces. Aries is rising with the Sun in it, the Moon 

is in Libra and Saturn is exalted there. Mars placed in Cancer aspects the Moon 

(This is in view of the phrase Teevravilochana Mars Is strong in his 4th glance). 

The reader should see for himself that in the above combination, Venus, the Sun 

and Saturn are exalted Jupiter is In his own sign. The Sun, Mars and Saturn are in 

Kendra.  Saturn  has  got  full  Digbala.  Mars  thougn  devoid  of  Digbala  has  got 

Neechabhanga Raja Yoga, as per verses 27 to 30 of this Chapter with the above 

combination,  the  lord  of  Ascendant  with Neechabhanga Raja  Yoga through the 

Moon definitely confers kingship on the native.

However,  according  to  the  interpretation  of  the  well  known  author  and 

commentator Pt. Gopesh Kumar Qjha, the disposition of planets should be as under 

:— Venus, Jupiter  and Saturn are in Pisces.  The Moon is full  and is  placed in 

Taurus in her sign of exaltation. The Sun is aspected by Mars and the Lagna is 

identical with Aries.

The Sun has to be in Scorpio for the Moon to be full and Mars has been in 

Taurus or Leo to be able to aspect the Sun. We feel that Shri Ojha's interpretation is 

not correct as the combination formed according to it is not strong enough to form 

a Raja Yoga and confer kingship on the native.

16. (a) The birth be at night (b) the Moon be in Cancer identical with 10th 

house, (c) benefics being in depression or inimical signs be posited in the 3, 6, 11 

houses or be in deep exaltation or be all posited in kendras uneclipsed. When the 

native has such a disposition of planets at birth, he becomes, a great king ruling the 

three worlds under one umbrella.

17.  If  the  full  Moon  be  in  Vargottamamsa,  the  person  born  becomes  a 

powerful King of the Earth and is highly renowned. He will possess an army with 

horses, the dust raised by whose hoofs overshadows the light of the Sun and it 

resembles that of the Moon in the morning.

18. Should Jupiter and the Moon be in kendra aspected by Venus with no 

planet in his sign of debilitation, the person born becomes king with unequalled 

fame.

19. If at birth the Moon be in a watery sign and Navamsa identical  with 

Lagna and also be in his own or benefic Varga, with no malefics in Kendra. the 

native becomes a King owning many elephants.

20. Five Yogas are described in this Verse which are as follows —

(a) If Venus is aspected by Jupiter a person born in a royal family becomes a 
87



King.

(b) If Jupiter occupies a sign other than Capricorn identical with Lagna, the 

native becomes a King with many elephants under his charge.

(c) A King will be born if in a nativity the lord of the Lagna vested with full 

strength occupies a Kendra.

(4) If at birth Mercury with full strength is posited in Kendra and is aspected 

by Jupiter, the native becomes so influential that the Kings act according to his 

advice.

21. Two Yogas are described in this Verse as described below —

(1) Even one planet posited in his sign of exaltation aspected by a friendly 

planet enables the native to become a king. If such a planet be also associated with 

a friendly planet, the native will become extremely rich and prosperous.

(2) If the Sun be in his own Navamsa and the Moon be in his own sign, the 

native becomes a King possessing many horses and elephants.

Note — In the Yoga mentioned at (2) above, it should be necessary for the 

Rasi of the Sun and the Navamsa of the Moon to be strong. The strength of a 

horoscope depends to a great extent on the strength of the Sun and the Moon.

22. There are again two Raja Yogas in this verse as described below: —

(1)  Should  the  Moon with  full  rays  be  in  Pisces  aspected  by  a  friendly 

planet, the native will become a king with pre-eminent position and delighting the 

world.

(2) Should the Moon be full and be in his sign of exaltation the native will 

become a very generous, charitable and praiseworthy King.

23. Should the Moon be in the Navamasa of an Adhimitra aspected fully by 

Venus. The native will become a very wealthy King.

Should the Moon in the above position be aspected by Jupiter, the person 

born will become a King reigning over the entire Earth.

24. The following are 4 Raja yogas declared by those versed in the science 

of Astrology —

(1) Malefics posited in the 3rd, 6th and 11th house counted from

88



The house occupied by the lord of Lagna, Moon or from the Lagna.

(2) Mars and Mercury occupying the 2nd house from the Lagna.

(3) The Sun and Venus located together in the 4th house.

(4) Mars, Saturn and Jupiter be housed respectively in the 10th, 11th and the 

Lagna.

25.  Should one out  of the lords of the 11th,  the 9th and the 2nd houses 

occupies a Kendra with reference to the Moon and should Jupiter own the 2nd, the 

5th or the 11th house, the Yoga so formed enables the person born to become the 

lord of a full fledged empire.

26. A planet in debilitation is considered adverse in effect. But there arise 

circumstances when the debilitation of such a planet is cancelled giving rise to 

Neechabhang Raja Yoga. These circumstances are explained below.

I at birth a planet is posited in sign of debilitation and the lord of the sign of 

debilitation be in Kendra from the Moon or Lagna or the planet that is exalted in 

the sign be in Kendra to the Moon or the Lagna, the debilitation of the Planet 

concerned gets cancelled and a Raja Yoga is formed enabling the native to become 

a very powerful King.

Note — There is some difference of opinion about the interpretation of the 

word  Uchchanatha.  Suppose  Saturn  is  in  the  Aries  in  debilitation  who will  be 

Uchchanatha  of  Saturn?  According  to  one  view  Saturn  is  exalted  in  Libra. 

Therefore lord of Libra, namely, Venus is the Uchchanatha. Another view is that 

Saturn being in Aries and the Sun is exalted in Aries. Therefore the Sun is the 

Uchchanatha.  In  our  view the  second  view is  more  appropriate.  There  is  also 

difference of opinion whether the conditions mentioned above have to be fulfilled 

before debilitation gets cancelled. Shri V. Subrahmanaya Shastri has taken the view 

that  any  of  the  two  conditions  should  be  enough  for  the  cancellation  of  the 

debilitation. Pt. Gopesh Kumar Ojha has taken the view that both the conditions 

have to be fulfilled. We are of the view that it should be enough for any of the two 

conditions to be fulfilled for the cancellation of the debilitation. Our view and that 

of Shri Shastri is supported by Jataka Parijata.

Saturn is in his sign of debilitation. His debilitation gets cancelled as Mars 

the lord of the sign in which Saturn is posted, in Kendra to the Lagna and the 

Moon. Sun who is exalted in Aries is also in Kendra to the Lagna.

Illustration

27. Should at birth a planet be posited in his sign of debilitation, and the lord 

of that depression sign and the lord of the planet's exaltation sign are in Kendra 

positions mutually, the debilitation gets cancelled The Neechabhanga Raja Yoga so 

formed produces a powerful King of Kings.

28. If a planet is in his sign of debilitation, and is aspected by the lord of that 

sign, the debilitation gets cancelled and by the Neechabhanga Raja Yoga so formed 

the native becomes a ruler of the Earth and famous. And if in the above Yoga if the 

planet be placed in an auspicious case still better effects may be expected.

29. When the planet is posited in his sign of debilitation, if the lord of the 

sign so occupied or the lord of the planet's exaltation sign be in a Kendra position 

with reference to the Lagna or the Moon, the person so born will become very 

wealthy  emperor.  He will  perform virtuous  actions  and will  be  very  powerful, 

famous and affluent.

30.  If  a  planet  in  his  sign  of  debilitation  be  in  a  Kendra  position  with 
90



reference  to  the  Moon  or  the  Lagna,  the  debilitation  gets  cancelled  and  the 

Neechabhanga Raja Yoga so formed will  produce an emperor revered by other 

Kings.

Nates  —  Thus  there  are  five  kinds  of  Neechabhanga  Raja  Yogas  as 

described below:—

(1) The lord of the depression sign or the planet that is exalted in that sign, is 

in a Kendra position from the Lagna or the Moon.

(2) The lord of the sign of debilitation and the lord of the exaltation sign of 

the debilitation planet are mutually in Kendra positions.

(3) The planet in the sign of debilitation is aspected by the lord of that sign.

(4) The lord of the sign of debilitation or the lord of the exaltation sign of the 

planet in debilitation, is in Kendra from the Lagna or the Moon.

(5) The planet in his sign of debilitation is in Kendra with reference to the 

Lagna or the Moon.

Thus  ends  the  seventh  chapter  on  "Maharaja  Yogas"  in  Phaladeepika  

composed by Mantreswara.

native will suffer from sorrow and misery from his very childhood and will be 

poverty stricken. He will be living shabbily and will be inactive.

Notes  — According  to  Brihat  Jataka  if  Saturn  occupied  the  Lagna  at  a 

person's birth, he will be poor, sickly, love-stricken, very unclean, Suffering from 

diseases during his childhood.  However,  if  any of the signs Sagittarius,  Pisces, 

Aquarius, Capricorn and Libra be the Lagna and Saturn should occupy it at birth, 

the person concerned will be equal to king, the headman of a village or the mayor 

of a city, a great scholar and will be handsome. Uttarakalamrit and Mansagari have

Should  Saturn  occupy  the  9th  house,  the  native  will  be  devoid  of  good 

fortune, wealth, children father and will be irreligious. He will also be wicked.

Notes  — A View has  been  taken  that  as  the  9th  house  is  the  house  of 

Dharma, Saturn occupying it will bring about a revolution in this sphere. If there 

be a Saturn endowed with strength in the 9th house and be aspected byjupiter, the 

person  will  follow  Dharmic  principles  strictly  and  will  be  a  tapasvi.  In  Ma 

Ananamayee's birth Saturn is exalted in the 9th (Aquarius Ascendent). In Swami 

Karpatri's birth chart Saturn is in the 9th and the Sun, Jupiter, Venus and Mercury 

are in the lagna idnentical with Cancer.

humiliation. He will associate with fallen women and will be separated from his 

own wife. He will suffer from diseases of the bowels and may lose his potency.

With  Ketu  occupying  the  8th  house  at  birth,  the  native  will  suffer  from 

separation from his nears and dears. He will be quarrelsome and shortlived. He 

will get injury from some weapon and will be unsuccessful in all his ventures.

Ketu  In  the  9th  house  at  birth,  makes  the  native  indulge  in  sinful  and 

unrighteous actions. He will be deprived of his father, will be unfortunate, poverty 

stricken and will defame others.

If Ketu occupies the 10th house at a person's birth, he will face obstacles in 

performing good acts. He will be impure and indulge in wicked actions. He will be 

very bold and famous for his valor.

If  Ketu  should  occupy  the  11th  house,  the  person  born  will  accumulate 

wealth and will be equipped with good qualities.  He will enjoy himself and all 

items of luxuries and comforts will be available to him. He will achieve success in 

all his undertakings.

When Ketu occupies the 12th house at birth, the native will commit sinful 

acts secretly. He will squander away all his money for undesirable purposes. He 

will destroy his wealth and take to forbidden conduct. He will suffer from diseases 

of the eyes.

34. The effects produced by a planet of the house, will be realized in full 

when he has traversed the number of degrees from the commencement of the Rashi 

equal to that traversed by the Lagna point in the Lagna Rashi.

It is the view of the authorities that Rahu is similar to Saturn and Ketu is 

103



similar to Mars in giving effects (Shani-vat Rahu, Kuja-vat Ketu).

Notes—For  example  (1)  if  the  Lagna  point  (Lagna  Bhava-Madhya)  is  1 

degree and the longitude of the Saturn posited in the 5th house is also 1 degree, 

Saturn will give the full effect of the 5th house.

(2) If the Lagna point is 29 degrees and Saturn's longitude in the 5th house is 

1 degree, Saturn will produce very little effect of the same house.

35. This verse is Intended to further explain the principle laid down in verse 

34.  Find out  how far  away is  the  planet  in  the  house whose effects  are  to  be 

assessed, from the Bhavamadhya of that house. The more it is nearer to the Bhava-

Madhya, the lesser will be the effects produced.

Notes  — Described  above are  the  general  effects  of  planets  in  different 

houses. These effects get modified by several factors such as the houses they own, 

aspects on them, conjunction of other planets with them, the signs in which they 

are posited, the position of their disposition etc.

For  detailed  information  in  this  respect  please  refer  to  our  English 

translation of 'Bhrigu Sutras' published by Ranjan Publications.

Thus ends the eighth chapter on "The Effects of the Planets in 12 Bhavas" In 

Phaladeepika composed by Mantreswara.

from an early age. He will beseperated from his parents and preceptor. He will 

indulge In cruel actions and will be honoured by the king. His feet will bear marks

106



13. After examining the native place,  form, colour etc.,  of any particular 

sign, its effects should be judiciously assessed. Whatever have been declared the 

effects arising out of a particular Ascendant, the same should also be said to come 

to pass, if the sign happens to be occupied by the Moon.

14. If at a birth a planet be in his sign of exaltation, the person concerned 

will become a ruler of the Earth and will receive praises from the kings. He will 

possess valuable treasures. He will be equipped with excellent qualities and will 

shine  like  king  Vikramaditya  in  his  administrative  policies,  fame,  valour 

generosity, courage and dexterity.

Notes - Our view is that with exaltation of one planet in a birth chart, the 

native cannot shine like king Vikramaditya or become a ruler of the Earth. The 

planet  in  exaltation  to  give  extraordinarily  good effect  should  be  placed  in  an 

auspicious house saved from any malefic influence and supported by other helpful 

planetary combinations and dispositions.

In this horoscope Sun lord of the 11th is exalted in the 7th house. He is 

associated with Mercury and Venus and aspected by Jupiter who is posited in his 

own. The Moon the lord of the 10th is in his own house. According to verse 14, the 

native should be more than a ruler of the Earth, but he happens an ordinary person 

belonging to middle class. The reason for this is that the exalted Sun is placed 

between malefics (Mars and Rahu on one side and Saturn on the other). According 

to Parasara Sun being lord of the 11th is a papi. According to Jataka Parijata Sun 

being lord of 11th is Badhaka.

He is aspected by Sun lord of the 3rd and the 6th. Therefore the Sun is deprived of 

auspiciousness.  Although the Moon lord of  the 10th is  in his  own sign,  she is 

aspected by Saturn from the 8th house. Thus no good can be expected from the 

Moon. For these reasons the native could not become a great men equal to a king.

This is the horoscope of Abraham Lincoln former President of the United 

States of America. He was a great man, very learned and a political leader with all 

the name and fame one can achieve. He held the most powerful position of the 

Head of State of the United States of American. In his horoscope Venus lord of the 

108



4th and 9th (a yoga karaka) is exalted in the 2nd and is associated with Jupiter lord 

of the 2nd and the 11th in his own house (2nd). There is no malefic aspect on them. 

Lord of lagna Saturn is in the 10th with evil aspect or influence on him. These 

planetary combinations and dispositions made him such great and powerful man.

15.  Should a planet  occupy his  own sign in  a birthchart,  the  native will 

during  the  dasa  of  such  a  planet  acquire  power  and  strength  through  the 

beneficience  of  a  wealthy  and  high  dignitary  and he  will  himself  achieve  that 

status. He will remain in his residence, acquire a new house and lands capable of 

producing every kind of crops. He will receive reverence from the people and may 

even get back his lost articles.

16. When a planet happens to be in the house of a friend at birth, the person 

concerned will achieve success through the help of his friends in all his ventures. 

His new friends will be blessed with good sons, wealth, grains and other fortunes 

and will get full support and cooperation from the people.

17. If a planet gets posited in an inimical sign, the person born will have an 

evil bent of mind. He will live in other people's houses and will eat their food. He 

will be without any means of livelihood and will be oppressed by enemies. Even 

his friends will become his enemies in the dasa of such a planet.

18.  If  a  planet  occupies  his  sign of  debilitation  in  a  nativity,  the  person 

concerned will, during the dasa of such a planet, be demoted from his position, will 

suffer actions, will become indebted and will depend on support of low people. He 

will live in insanitary auditions, will perform menial tasks, will walk long distances 

on foot and will do disastrous acts.

19. If a planet be combust (eclipsed by the Sun's rays), the native will during 

his Dasa, will die within a short period. His wife, children as well as his wealth 

will also be destroyed. He involved in quarrels without cause or reason and suffer 

from the others. He will also be insulted by others.

A planet posited in a netural sign will not produce any significant effect and 

maintain status quo.

20. When a planet happens to be retrograde in motion, he will produce the 

109



same effect as if he is posited in exaltation sign, even if he may be in his enemy's 

sign or in the sign of his debilitation. A planet who is vargottama produces effects 

as if he is in his own sign.

110



Chapter 10

Matters relating to the 7th House

1. The 5th and 7th houses from the lagna or the Moon be flourished if they 

are associated with or aspected by benefics or their lords, if it is not so, they will 

not be fruitful.

If there be malefics in the 12th, 4th and 8th houses or if Venus be hemmed in 

between two malefics or if Venus be associated or aspected by malefics the native 

will lose his wife (his wife will die).

2. If the lord of the 7th house occupies the 5th, the native will lose his wife 

or he will become sonless. If the lord of the 5th or the 8th be in the 7th, the wife of 

the  native  does  not  survive.  If  the  weak Moon be in  the  5th  and the malefics 

occupy the Ascendant, 7th and 12th houses the person concerned will be without 

wife and children. If the Sun and Rahu occupy the 7th house, the native will suffer 

loss of wealth through association with women.

3. The native loses his wife if there are any of the following disposition of 

planets present at brith:—

(a) Venus in Scorpio in the 7th house.

(b) Mercury in Taurus in the 7th house.

(c) Jupiter in Capricorn in the 7th house.

(d) Saturn in Pisces in the 7th house.

(e) Mars in Pisces in the 7th house.

However, if Mars and Saturn occupy the 7th house identical with Cancer the 

native will be blessed with a wife who is beautiful and of good character.

4. The native is deprived of his wife if the 7th house or its lord be associated 

with or  aspected by malefics,  hemmed in beetween malefics,  be in his  sign of 

debilition or an inimical sign or be eclipsed by the Sun's rays.

The native will lose his wife or will have a crippled wife, when Venus in 

conjunction with malefic occupies the 7th, 5th or 9th house.

The native will have illicit relations with other people's wives if Venus be in 

111



the Varga of Mars or Saturn or be aspected by these planets.

5. If Mars and Saturn be in the 7th from the Venus and Moon in any nativity, 

the person concerned will be wifeless and childless.

If there be a hermaphrodite planet in the 7th house, and the 11th house is 

occupied by two planets, the person concerned will have two wives.

A person will have two wives in the event of both the lord of the 7th and 

Venus being posited in a dual sign or amsa.

The number of wives should be generally ascertained from the number of 

planets that are in conjunction with the lord of 7th house and Venus.

6. The native will associate with as many women as is the number of planets 

posited in the 7th house. The number of women, who will die, will be equal to the 

number  of  malefics,  and the  number  of  benefics  will  represent  the  number  of 

women who will survive.

Should the lord of the 7th house be a benefic endowed will strength, the 

native will have a wife who will be of good character and will bear children.

Even a malefic if he being lord of 7th be posited in the 7th will bless the 

native with a good wife.

Benefics in the 7th house will produce good effects unless they happen to be 

lords of the 6th, 8th or 12th house.

7. Loss of wife will result if the 2nd and 7th houses are associated with or 

aspected by malefics. The result will invariably be untoward in the case of malefic 

aspects.

Similar results may be declared from the wife's nativity if the 7th and 8th 

houses are similarly afflicted.

But should the above two houses be associated with or aspected by benefics, 

the couple will enjoy good luck and comforts.

8. If in a female's birth chart, the Moon and Saturn be together in the 7th 

house, the native marries again (after the first marriage).

If there be such a planetary disposition in man's nativity, he will be wifeless 

or childless.

112



If malefics in their signs of debilitation be posited in the 2nd, 7th and 8th, in 

female's nativity the disposition will make her a widow and in a man's chart, it will 

render him a widower.

9. If the 7th house from the Ascendant be an even sign and the lord of the 

7th and Venus be also posited in even signs, and if the lord of the 5th and 7th 

possessed of strength be not eclisped by Sun's rays, the native will be blessed with 

wife and children.

10. The native will be happy and will be blessed with wife and children, if 

the lords of the 2nd, 7th and 12th be posited in kendra or trikona aspected by 

Jupiter  and  there  be  benefics  in  the  2nd,  7th  and  11th  to  the  lord  of  the  7th 

wherever he may be.

11. Note the sign and navamsa in male s nativity. The signs in which the 

lords of the ascendant and 7th are posited, the Janma Rashi (Moon sign) of the 

wife will  be triangular  to such sign or navamsa, or it  may be the exaltation or 

depression sign of the lords of the 1st and 7th or it be that sign which contains the 

largest number of benefic dots in the Moon's Ashtakavarga of the husband.

12. The direction of the country of the wife will be indicated by the sign 

owned by the strongest of the three planets, namely (1) the planet posited in the 7th 

house, (2) the lord of the 7th house and (3) Venus.

The marriage of the native should take place when the Venus or the lord of 

the 7th transits through a sign which is trine to the sign or navamsa occupied by the 

lord of the ascendant.

13. The marriage is likely to take place during the dasha of the planet (1) 

occupying the 7th house, (2) which aspects the 7th house or (3) the lord of the 7th 

house. It can also take place when the lord of the ascendant transits through the 

sign representing the 7th house.

14. Find out who amongst (1) the lord of the sign in which lord of the 7th is 

posited and the lord of the navamsa which the lord of the 7th occupies and (2) 

Venus and Moon, is stronger. The marriage will take place in the dasha of this 

stronger planet when Jupiter in transit passes through the sign triangular to the sign 

113



or navamsa occupied by the lord of the 7th.

15.  If  the lord of the 7th be posited in his sign of debilitation,  be in an 

inimical  sign,  be  combust  or  be  aspected  by  a  malefic  and  the  7th  house  be 

occupied or aspected by a malefic, there will be loss of wife. So say the men well 

versed in the science of Astrology.

Thus ends the tenth chapter on "Kalatra Bhava" in Phaladeepika composed 

by Mantreswara.

Chapter 11

Female Horoscopy

1. Whatever effects have been declared for men, they are entirely appicable 

to women too, or to their husbands. The woman's prosperity and happiness have to 

be  deducted  from  the  8th  house  (from  the  Lagna  or  the  Moon  whichever  is 

stronger).  Consideration  of  children  should  be  made  from  the  9th  house  and 

matters relating to her appearance, looks etc., should be examined from the Langa. 

It is from the 7th house that her welfare (power of influencing the husband) and the 

(nature of the husband) should be assessed, while her association with other men 

and chastity should be assessed from an examination of the 4th house. Benefics in 

these  houses  produce  good  results  while  malefics  in  the  above  houses  are 

productive of evil unless they happen to own the house in which the effect will be 

good.

Notes — This is a very important verse of this chapter. It will, therefore, be 

useful for the readers to know what other authorities have said in this regard.

Saravali

From the 8th house her widowhood can be deducted while the ascendant 

deals with her physique, the 7th house with her husband's good fortunes and the 

5th house with her offspring.

Brihat Jataka

Of  the  effects  that  have  been  described  till  now  in  the  case  of  male 

horoscopes, all those that may be found in (female horoscope) suitable to females 

should be declared as applicable to them alone; the rest should be ascribed to their 

husbands. Hie death of the husband is to be declared through the 8th place (from 

the Langa or the Moon whichever is stronger). Matters relating to her appearance, 

beauty etc., should be determined from the Lagna and the sign occupied by the 

Moon. It is from the 7th place (from the Lagna or the Moon whichever is stronger) 

that her welfare (happiness) and the (nature of the husband) should be assertained.

115



Jataka Parijata

Whatever effect may accrue from the horoscope of female that is applicable 

only to men, should be ascribed to the husband. The good and evil affecting their 

person should be calculated from the Moon and the Lagna whichever of them is 

stronger. It is from the 7th place from the Lagna or the Moon that all that is worthy 

or unworthy in the husband should be ascertained and the death of the husband is 

foretold through the 8th bhava (from the Lagna or the Moon). All this should be 

well  weighted by the strength or weakness of the planets,  benefic and malefic, 

before an announcement is made.

Of the Lagna and the Moon, find which is stronger. It is well reference to the 

luck, beauty and strenght of women should be announced. Children and wealth in 

abundance should be declared through the 9th bhava therefrom. Wedded happiness 

or otherwise should be gathered from the 8th bhava; husband's fortune from the 

7th. Some astrologers opine that the well being or the reverse of the husband can 

be determined from the 9th bhava.

Some hold that widowhood is found out through the 8th bhava. Beauty, fame 

and fortune through the Lagna, the son through the 5th, ascertain as well exceeding 

tranquility  of  women  through  the  planets  occupying  the  9th  bhava.  All  else 

whether due to the bhavas or yogas are the same in regard to both men and women.

Brihat Parasara Hora Shastra

The physique of the woman should be ascertained from the Lagna, offspring 

from the 5th, happiness of the husband from the 7th and widowhood from 6th. 

Those effects which are not applicable to women should be ascertained to their 

husbands.

We would like to comment on two of the various matters described above.

(1) Whether the effects not applicable to women should be ascertained to 

their husbands.

(2) From which house should we examine matters relating to children.

As regards  (1)  the  time  have  now completely  changed  and women now 

enjoy equal opportunities in all fields. Now women are holding high posts in the 

116



scientific, engineering, financial and administrative spheres. We are, therefore, of 

the view that the effects of Raja Yogas, Adhiyogas, etc., present in their horoscopes 

should be aplicable to them and not to their husbands. They can apply to husbands 

in case they are entirely dependent on them.

As regards (2) the most appropriate and logical house from which the matter 

of children should be examined, is the 5th house and in this sphere no distinction 

should be made between male's and female's horoscope. The view of Parasara as 

given  in  the  Brihat  Parasara  Hora  Shastra  should  be  treated  as  the  most 

authoritative.  Birhat  Jataka  is  silent  about  this  which  means  that  it  makes  no 

differentiation  between  a  male's  horoscope  and  female's  horoscope  about  this 

matter. Saravali has followed the view expressed in Brihat Parasara Hora Shastra.

2. If in a female's nativity both the Ascendant and the Moon are in even 

signs and be aspected by benefics, the native will be blessed with good sons and 

husband will be of good character and will wear ornaments. She will be prosperous 

and will possess praiseworthy qualities. If, however, both the Ascendant and the 

Moon be in odd signs and be aspected by malefics, the woman concerned will be 

masculine in bearing, of wicked disposition, beyond the control of the husband, 

insincere, wrathful and poor.

3. If the 7th house or the setting navamsa be owned by a benefic, the woman 

born will be blessed with a husband who will be handsome, well reputed, learned 

and wealthy. If it be otherwise, the husband will be deformed, stupid, deceitful and 

poor and the native will be separated from her husband. If Mars be posited there, 

she will become a widow, both benefics and malefics occupy the 7th house, she 

will  remarry. If there be a malefic or malefics in the 8th house,  she will  get a 

shortlived husband. If the 2nd house is occupied by malefics, the native dies with 

her husband.

Note-it is believed that if the mischief of Mars, Saturn, Rahu, Ketu and the 

Sun be similar in the horoscopes of both husband and wife, they are not harmed in 

any way.

4. If in a female's nativity, the Moon is in Taurus, Leo, Virgo or Scorpio 

117



identical with the 5th house, the native will have a limited number of Issues. If the 

7th house or the setting navamsa belongs to Saturn, Mars or the Sun, the native 

will have a diseased sexual organ. If the 4th house be occupied by malefic planets, 

the native will be unchaste.

If the Ascendant, "the Moon and Venus beta a sign or navamsa of Saturn or 

Mars, the native will become a prostitute.

5. If the 7th house or the setting navamsa belongs to be benefic, the female 

born, will have beautiful hips and will be very fortunate.

If the Moon, the Ascendant and the 4th house be connected with benefics 

(by conjunction, lordship or aspects), the woman concerned will be chaste and will 

possess excellent qualities.

If benefics be posited in trikonas, the native will be happy, will be blessed 

with sons (children), full of good qualities and wealthy. If there be malefics in the 

above mentioned houses, she will either be barren or she will give birth to still 

born children.

6-8. Find out which of the Moon and the Lagna is stronger. The one which is 

stronger  if  (i)  in  Aries  or  Scorpio  and  in  the  trimsamsa  of  Mars  the  woman 

concerned will be ill-behaved. If it be in the trimsamsa of Saturn she will be maid 

servant. If it be in trimsamsa of Jupiter she will be cultured and wealthy. If it be in 

the trimsamsa of Mercury, she will be deceitful and if it be in the trimsamsa of 

Venus she will be of bad character.

If the Moon or Lagna. whichever is stronger, is in Taurus or Libra in the 

trimsamsa  of  Mars,  the  woman  concerned  will  be  of  bad  character,  in  the 

trimsamsa of Saturn she will resort to another husband, in the trimsamsa of Jupiter, 

she will be respected, in the trimsamsa of Mercury, she will be learned and in the 

trisamsa of Venus she will be famous.

If the Moon or the Lagna, whichever is stronger, be in Gemini or Virgo, in 

the trimsamsa of Mars she will be deceitful, in the trimsamsa of Saturn she will be 

eunuch,  in  the  trimsamsa  of  Jupiter,  she  will  be  chaste,  in  the  trimsamsa  of 

Mercury she will be full of good qualities and in the trimsamsa of Venus she will 

118



be repining.

If the Moon or Lagna, whichever is stronger, be in Cancer, in the trimsamsa 

of Mars she will be self willed and uncontrolled, in the trimsamsa of Saturn she 

will  kill  her  husband,  in  the  trimsamsa  of  Jupiter,  she  will  be  endowed  with 

distinguished qualities, in the trimsamsa of Mercury, she will be skilled in arts and 

in the trimsamsa of Venus, she will be full of virtues.

If the Moon or the Lagna, whichever is stronger, be in Sagittarius or Pisces 

in the trimsamsa of Mars, she will be maid servant, in the trimsamsa of Saturn she 

will be enamoured of persons other than her husband. In the trimsamsa of Jupiter 

she will possess many good qualities, in the trimsamsa of Saturn she will have 

little desire for sexual intercourse, in the trimsamsa of Jupiter, she will be endowed 

with many good qualities, in the trimsamsa of Mercury she will be skilled in the 

arts, and in the trimsamsa of Venus she will be very chaste.

If  the Moon or the Lagna,  whichever is  stronger, be in the Capricorn or 

Aquarius, in the trimsamsa of Mars, she will be a maid servant; in the trimsamsa of 

Saturn, she will be enamoured of persons other than her husband; in the trimsamsa 

of  Jupiter,  she  will  keep  her  husband  under  her  control;  in  the  trimsamsa  of 

Mercury she will be unchaste and in the trimsamsa of Venus she will be issueless 

and poor.

If the Moon or the Lagna, whichever is stronger, be in Leo, in the trimsamsa 

of Mars she will be a wicked wife; in the trimsamsa of Saturn she will be without 

any character; in the trimsamsa of Jupiter she will be wife of king or landlord; in 

the  trimsamsa  of  Mercury  she  will  be  masculine  in  her  behaviour  and  in  the 

trimsamsa of Venus she will have attachment for a person other than her husband.

9. The elder brother of the husband, the mother-in-law, father-in-law and 

younger brother will die (soon after the marriage), if the girl is born in Jyestha, 

Ashlesha, Moola and Vishakha nakshatras respectively.

The  girls  born  in  Chitra,  Ardra,  Satabhisha,  Jyestha,  Moola,  Kritika  or 

Pushyami nakshatras will become, barrens, widows, mothers whose children do 

not survive, cast away by husbands or poor.

119



10. If the Moon, lords of the Ascendant, the 7th and the 9th house associated 

with benefics be posited In good houses and be of brilliant rays (not eclipsed), the 

woman concerned will be held in high esteem by her relations. She will do many 

good deeds, will be very pretty and be prosperous. She will please her husband, 

bear good sons and be virtuous in her disposition, the period of this happy life with 

depending  on  the  strength  derived  by  the  eighth  house  from benefics  through 

association or aspect.

11. If a woman's menses commences when the Moon is in an Anupachaya 

house (1, 2. 4, 5, 7, 8, 9 and 12) and is aspected by Mars, they (menses) become 

favourable to conception and not otherwise.

The husband should sow the seed when the Moon occupies an Upachaya 

house (3, 6, 10, 11) in respect of the female's nativity and is aspected by Jupiter. 

This is to be done at an auspicious Lagna with many good points in its favour and 

unconnected with (Parva) and other objectionable period of time.

Thus ends the eleventh chapter on "Women Horoscopy" in Phaladeepika  

composed by Mantreswara.

Chapter 12

Matters relating to the birth of Children

(The 5th house)

1. The native will assuredly be blessed with children as an effect of any of 

the following planetary dispositions:

(1) If Jupiter and lords of the 5th with reference to the Lagna and the Moon 

be well placed and the 5th house has the aspect of a benefic planet or a planet 

owning an auspicious house (i.e. other than the 6th. 8th or 12th). or

(2) If the lords of the Lagna and the 5th house are placed together in a house 

or  have  mutual  benefic  aspect  and  have  interchanged  positions  amongst 

themselves.

2. The native will have no issue in the following circum stances:

(1)  When the 5th  house  reclined from Lagna,  the  Moon and Jupiter  are 

associated with or aspected by malefics without any benefic association or aspect.

(2) When the above houses are hemmed in between malefics.

(3) When the lords of these houses are in 6th, 8th or 12th.

3. If a malefic lord of the 5th house, occupies it. the native will be blessed 

with children.

When the 5th house is occupied by a malefic,  the person concerned will 

have sons in plenty.

If a benefic lord of the 5th house occupies his own house or be in his sign of 

exaltation in that house, there will be loss of children.

The signs Scorpio, Leo and Virgo when they represent the 5th house are 

termed as childless signs and will give a limited number of children and that also 

after a long interval.

Notes: We find it difficult to believe that a benefic planet as lord of the 5th 

will destroy the progeny when he happens to occupy his own house. According to 

Shri  Gopesh  Kumar  Ojha  that  if  a  benefic  lord  of  the  5th  occupies  the  5th 

alongwith a malefic, there is loss of children. Even this has not been found correct 
121



in our experience. Please see in this connection the following horoscope.

Here the 5th lord Venus is a benefic. He occupies his own house with Mars 

and Moon (waning) both malefics. The native is blessed with children.

4. The native will  have a child late  to life  after  a great  effect under the 

following circumstances:

(1) When the Sun be in the 5th in a childless sign and Saturn and Mars be in 

the 8th and the Ascendant respectively.

(2) When the 5th house falls in a childless sign and Saturn, Jupiter, and Mars 

be to the Ascendant, the 8th and 12th respectively.

(3) When there be the Moon in the 11th, a malefic the 5th from Jupiter be 

occupied by a malefic and the several planets occupy the Ascendant.

(2) When the 5th house falls in a childless sign and Saturn. Jupiter, and Mars 

be in the Ascendant, the 8th and 12th respectively.

(3) When there be the Moon in the 11th. a malefic in the 5th from Jupiter be 

occupied by a malefic and the several planets occupy the Ascendant.

5.  The native will  have children after  second marriage if  Mars or  Venus 

alone occupies the 5th house identical with Cancer.

Saturn alone in Cancer in the 5th house gives many sons. Mercury alone in 

Cancer in the 5th house gives very few sons.
122



The Moon alone in his own sign in the 5th house gives a limited number of 

sons.

Jupiter singly in his sign of exaltation gives many daughters.

6. The following four planetary combinations led to the extinction of the 

family:—

(1) A malefic in the 4th, Venus in the 7th and the Moon in the 10th.

(2) Malefics in the Ascendant, the 5th, 8th and 12th.

(3) Mercury and Venus in the 7th, Jupiter in the 5th and malefics in the 4th.

(4) The Moon in the 5th and malefics in the Ascendant, the 8th and 12th.

7. If the malefics occupy the Ascendant, the lord of the Ascendant

be in the 5th. the lord of the 5th in the 3rd and the Moon in the 4th, the 

native will be devoid of any issue.

Should the Moon occupy the 5th house in an odd sign or an odd navamsa 

and be aspected by the Sun. the native will either be issuless or will be distressed 

on account of issues.

8. The native will  have a son by adoption under the following planetary 

dispositions:—

(1) If the 5th house be identical with Gemini. Virgo, Capricorn or Aquarius 

and be occupied or aspected by Saturn or Mandi.

(2) If the lord of the 5th house be weak and be in no way connected with the 

lords of the Ascendant and the 7th.

9.  The  native  will  have  to  suffer  loss  of  children  in  the  following 

circumstances:—

(1) If the lord of the 5th be in his sign of debilitation or in an inimical sign or 

be associated with any of the lords of the 6th, 8th or 12th.

(2) The lord of the 5th is in the 5th without receiving any benefic aspect.

10. If the lord of the 5th house. Jupiter.  Mars and the Sun (they may be 

anywhere)  are posited in male navamsas, the native will  be blessed with many 

sons. So say the sages. The nature good or otherwise of the sons will depend on the 

strength of the 5th house.

123



11. If the 5th house or its lord be in a male sign or navamsa or be associated 

with and aspected by male planets, the native will have all male issues. There will 

be birth of daughter if the 5th or its lord be in a female sign or navamsa or be 

associated with or aspected by female planets.

12. Conception may take place when the Sun and Venus in a male's nativity 

and Mars and Venus in the case of a female's nativity are vested with adequate 

strength and pass their signs or navamsas identical with an upachaya house.

13. The number of issues is to be ascertained by examining the number of 

planets in the 5th house and at the sometime that are not (1) inimical (2) in their 

sign  of  debilitation  and  (3)  in  inimical  navamsa.  The  same  could  also  be 

ascertained by study of the number of planets similarly situated but in conjunction 

with the lord of the 5th house.

The study of benefic dots of planets in the 5th house from Jupiter or the 

navamsa occupied by the Sun, also enables one to guess the number of issues. ln 

this  verse  is  explained  the  method  of  ascertaining  female  and  male  nativities 

whettor they are physically capable of producing children.

14. In the case of a female nativity add the longitudes (spast) of the Moon, 

Mars  and  Jupiter.  If  the  result  comes  to  an  even  sign  and  even  navamsa,  the 

strength of fecundity in the female for producing issues is assured. If it is mixed 

(i.e.  sign male and navamsa female or vice versa), she will  be able to produce 

children after great effort.

In the case of a male nativity if the sum total of the longitudes of the Sun, 

Venus and Jupiter denotes an odd sign and an odd navamsa, it is Indicative of the 

strong physical capacity of the male to produce children and in case one of the two 

(sign and navamsa) be even, the result will be mixed.

Notes — If in the case of female nativity the sum total denotes odd sign and 

odd navamsa,  and in  a  male's  nativity  the  result  signifies  even sign  and  even 

navamsa, their physical  capacity to produce children will be almost nil  or very 

weak.

15.  Subtract  five  times  the  longitude  of  the  Sun  from  five  times  the 

124



longitude of the Moon. If the Tithi represented by the result be an auspicious one in 

the bright half of the lunar month, the native will definitely have progeny without 

much effort. But if the resulting Tithi be one of the dark half of the month, the 

effect will be taken to be negative. It is by close examination of the Tithi-whether it 

is auspicious or is auspicious in both the Pakshas — bright and dark — that one 

has to ascertain whether the native will have issues or not. During an Amavasya, a 

Chidra Tithi, the Vishti karana or any of the Sthlra karanas, there will be no Issue 

at all.

Notes—The  Chidra  Tithis  are  (1)  Chaturthi,  (2)  Shasti,  (3)  Ashtami,  (4) 

Navami, (5) Dwadashi and (6) Chaturdashi. These days are generally avoided for 

any auspicious function.

There are 11 karanas distributed over the 30 Tithis of the lunar month at the 

rate of 2 karanas for each Tithi. The four of these (1) Chatuspada, (2) Nagava. (3) 

Kirnstugne and (4)  Sakune are called Sthira  karanas and are so named as they 

permanently hold two over the four half Tithis commencing from the second half 

of  Krishna Paksha Chaturdashi.  The other  seven viz..  (1)  Bava (2)  Balava,  (3) 

Kailava, (4) Tatthila, (5) Garaya, (6) Vaniya and (7) Vishta or Bhadra are called 

Char or movable karanas and occur In 8 cycles to preside over the remaining 56 

half  — to  this  of  the  lunar  month  beginning  the  later  half  of  Shukla  paksha 

prathama.

Remedial Measures

16-18. Should, however, the result happen to be one of the Chidra Tithis, the 

Vlshtl Karana or a Sthir Karana, the remedial measure to worship lord Krishna by 

recitation of  Purusha Sukta  Mantras to ward off  the barrenness threatening the 

faimty.  If  the  resultant  Tlthl  comes out  to  be  Shastl,  the  native  ought  to  offer 

prayers to God Subramanya. If it be Chaturthi the lord of the Serpents has to be 

appeased. If It be navami, the recitation of Ramayana and listening to Ramayana is 

the remedy. If it is Ashtami, the Sravana Vrata by fasting has to be observed. If it 

be Chaturdasi the native should worship God Rudra (Shiva) by Rudraparayana. If 

the Tithi be Dwadashi he should appease the gods by feeding the needy. If it be 

125



Amavasya or Poornamasi the Manes have to be propitiated. These measures are 

absolutely essential to be observed with greater care and attention when the Tithi 

happens  to  be  one  among the  last  five,  namely  after  Krishna  paksha  Dasami. 

Generally, In the dark half of a month to which so ever of the three division a Tithi 

may belong, worship ought to be resorted to: the particular deity to be propitiated 

being Nagaraja in the first division, namely l-5Tlthi, Skanda in the second (next 

five Tithis i.e. 6-10) and Hari in the third or last five.

19. If in any nativity, the lord of the 5th house be in his inimical or sign of 

debilitation,  be  combust  or  be  posited  in  6th,  8th  or  12th  house  there  is  no 

possibility  of  native  getting  an  issue.  If  the  planet  in  the  5th  house  be  in  his 

inimical  sign  or  sign  of  debilitation  or  be  the  lord  of  the  6th,  8th  or  12th. 

childlessness will be the definite consequence. He ought to divine the source of the 

same by an examination of the particular deity, tree and animal represented by the 

sign occupied by the planet.

20-22. If the obstacle causing planet is the Sun, the person concerned will be 

sonless  due to  disrespect  shown to God Shiva and Garuda and the consequent 

curse of the Manes. If such a planet be the Moon, it will be due to displeasure and 

anger of the mother, Sumangli or other respectful woman owing to her feelings 

having been hurt. If the planet concerned be Mars, tt will be due to some fault due 

to the village deity, to God Kartikeya, to an enemy or one's Dayadins. In the case 

of Mercury, the sonlessness will be due to crimes of youngester or to the killing of 

spawns (eggs of fishes and similar creatures), or the displeasure of God Vishnu. If 

the cause of sonlessness be due to Jupiter, it will be due to harm caused to the 

hereditary Brahma family priest or the destruction of a tree full of fruits. If the 

childlessness causing be Venus, it will be due to cutting of a tree full of flowers or 

harm to a virtuous woman or to the cows or a sinful deed to people that ought to be 

revered. If Saturn be the planet responsible for causing childlessness, it will be due 

to the destruction of an Aswatha or Peepal tree or on account of wrath of yama or 

through departed spirits, goblins and the like. If Rahu should occupy the 5th house 

or be associated with the lord of that house, it will be due to the curse of a serpent. 

126



In the case of Ketu, it will be owing to the curse of a serpent. In the case of Ketu, it 

will be owing to the curse of a Brahmin. If Mandi be the cause of obstruction, it 

will be due to the curse of departed spirits. If Venus and the Moon in conjunction 

with Mandi should cause childlessness, it will be on account of the killing of a 

woman or a cow. If Jupiter or Ketu in conjuction with Mandi be in the 5th house, 

the sonlessness will be due to the killing of a Brahmin.

23. The sins accured by one's actions in many previous births have been 

described in nativity  which lead to childlessness and to ward off which and to 

secure a son, the learned in Astrology have recommended particular Japs, Charities 

and such other good action prescribed for several planets.

24.  A  holy  bath  in  Rameshwaram,  engaging  oneself  in  reciting  holy 

scriptures, worhsip of God Shiva, observation of holy austerities with reference to 

(propitiate)  God  Vishnu,  Charities,  ceremonies  in  honour  of  departed  souls, 

installation  of  the  serpent  deity  —  these  are  various  remedial  measures 

recommended by which one can be blessed with sons (children).

25. The birth of a son should possibly take place in the dasha or antar dasha 

of any of the following planets:-

(1) The lord of the ascendent, (2) the lord of the 7th house, (3) the lord of the 

5th  house,  (4)  Jupiter,  (5)  the  planet  aspecting  the  5th  house,  (6)  the  planet 

occupying the 5th house.

When  Jupiter  passes  through  in  transit  the  triangular  sign  to  the  sign 

occupied  by  the  lord  of  the  5th  or  yama kantaka,  birth  of  a  son  may  also  be 

expected.

26. The birth of a son is likely to take place, when the lord of the ascendant 

during his transit (1) gets into conjunction with the lord of the 5th house, (2) passes 

through his sign of exaltation or (3) occupies his own sign passing through in his 

transit of the ascendant through the 5th house or the sign occupied by the lord of 

the 5th is also an opportune period for the birth of children.

27. Add the longitudes of (1) the lord of the ascendant, (2) the lord of the 7th 

house, and (3) the lord of the 5th house. During the course of the major period 

127



represented  by  the  owner  of  the  nakshatra  resulting from the  sum total  of  the 

longitudes  of  the  above plantes  and in  the  sub-period of  any of  the  following 

planets will the birth of a son (children) take place—

(1) The planet occupying the 5th house,

(2) the planet aspecting the 5th house and

(3) the lord of the 5th.

28. Find out which amongst the (1) lord of the 5th house, (2) the lord of the 

sign occupied by the lord of the 5th house and (3) the lord of the navamsa of the 

lord of the 5th house (4) the lord of the sign occupied by jupiter and (5) the lord of 

the navamsa occupied by Jupiter is a strong planet. The birth of a son (children) 

may be expected in the major or sub-period of this strong planet.

29. Find out the sign of 5th from Jupiter and the sign and navamsa of its 

lord. When Jupiter in transit is triangular to that sign or navamsa, the birth of a son 

(children) may be predicted.

According  ta  other  authorities  on  the  subject,  a  learned  man  ought  to 

investigate indications of the birth of children from the positions of the planet at 

the time of the birth of the native.

30. Find out the lord of the nakshatra occupied by the Moon and that of the 

5th from it. Add the longitudes of the two plantes. When Jupiter passes in transit 

through the sign represented by this result or through one of its triangular ones, the 

birth of a son is possible.

31. The birth of a son (child) is likely to take place when the Sun In his 

transit  passes  the  third  sign  representing  the  Nisheka  Lagna  or  transits  a  sign 

triangular to the Adhana Lagna.

32. If the birth of a son takes place In a Lagna which is 5th or 9th to the 

Adhana,  it  should  be  understood  that  such  a  birth  Is  due  to  virtuous  deeds 

performed in the previous births.

If the Adhana Lagna is occupied or aspected by benefics, the person born 

will be longlived, wealthy and happy.

33. Find out the exact Dwadasamsa of the Mars at the time of Adhana and 

128



the sign in which he was posited (count from Aries or from this sign as many signs 

as the number represented by Dwadasamsa in question). When Moon Is In the sign 

so found in the month of delivery,  the birth  of the child to the womb may be 

protected.

34. The prediction should be made from the consideration of the positions of 

the serveral planets with reference to the Moon and the Lagna at the time of a 

query, adoption of a son. investiture of sacred thread, the gift of a girl, the first 

maturity or the time of conception, as he would if a birth had taken place at the 

time.

Thus ends the twelfth chapter on "Progeny "in Phaladeeplka composed by  

Mantreswara.

129



Chapter 13

Determination of Longevity

1.  The  first  thing  to  be  considered  after  the  birth  of  the  child  is  the 

examination  of  his  longevity.  The  other  effects  should  be  judged  later.  If  the 

nativity indicates some merits like Raja Yoga etc., their effects should be assessed 

in consultation with those who are proficient in the knowledge of Astrology.

2. There is difference of opinion about the actual time of birth of the child. 

The various views are —

(1) The time of birth is that when the head (of the infant) emerges.

(2) The time of birth is that when the body of the infant emerges and touches 

the ground.

(3)  The  time of  birth  is  that  when the  body  of  the  infant  is  completed, 

separated from the mother's womb.

3. In the case of human beings, it is not possible to determine the longevity 

of a child within the first twelve years. Even if the nativity shows good longevity, 

the child meets his death owing to the sinful actions of the parents (during this or 

previous births).

4. If the child dies within the first four year it will be due to the mother's 

sins. Death taking place between four to eight year will be due to the sins of the 

father. If the death takes place between eight and twelve years, it will be due to the 

native's own sinful actions in the previous births.

5. With a view to escape from the evil effects described above the father 

should resort to remedial measures mentioned below to promote the longevity of 

the child and for his protection. The father should arrange for the performance of 

religious rites preceded by the incantations of mantras and offerings of oblations 

by  the  pouring  of  ghee  etc.,  in  the  holy  fire  on  every,  birth  day  of  the  child 

(according to lunar month) till  the 12th year. This should be suppplemented by 

appropriate medical treatment where necessary.

6. The first eight year's period of a man's life is treated as Balarishta. Thus 

130



that afflict him till the 20th year are said to be due to Yogarishta (evils produced by 

planetary dispositions). When the longevity extends to 32, it is called alpayus or 

short life. It is called Madhyamayus or middle age when the span of life extends to 

70 years. It is Poornayus when the period of life extends to 100 years.

7. A hundred years is generally recognised as the span of life for human 

beings. The division of this period Into three portions constitutes respectively the 

Alpayu, Madhyamayu and Poornayu and this is recognised universally.

8.  If  the  birth  occurs  in  the  evil  yogas  -  Dinamrityu,  Dinaroga  or 

Vishaghatikala, the child will die immediately after birth.

Notes— Described below are the Dinamrityu, Dinaroga and Vishagatikala 

Yogas.

Dina mrityu— There is this yoga when the birth is during the day in the first 

quarter of Dhanishta and hasta, in the 2nd quarter of Uttarabhadra and Ashlesha, 

and the fourth quarter of Bharani and Moola. These yogas do not cause any evil 

effect if the birth is during the night.

Dinaroga — There is this yoga when the birth occurs during the day in the 

first quarter of Ashlesha and Uttarabhadra, in the second quarter of Bharani and 

Moola, in the third quarter of Uttaraphalguni and Sravana and in the fourth quarter 

of Swati and Mrigashira. These yogas will cause no evil effects if the birth occurs 

during the night.

Vishagatikala — Every nakshatra has ghatikas of Vishagatikala as under —

Aswin 50-54, Bharani 24-28, Krittika 30-34, Rohini 40-44, Mrigashira 14-

18, Aridra 21-25, Punarvasu 30-34, Pushyami 20-24, Ashlesha 32-36, Makha 30-

34,  Poorvaphalguni  20-24,  Uttaraphalguni  18-22,  Hasta  21-25,  Chlttra  20-24, 

Swati  14-18,  Visakha  14-18.,  Anuradha  10-14,  Jyestha  14-18,  Mcx)la  56-60, 

Poorvashada  24-281  Uttarashada  20-24,  Saravana  10-14,  Dhanista  10-14, 

Shatabhlsha 18-22, Poorvabhadra 16-20, Uttarabhadra 24-28 and Revati 30-34.

If the birth occurs in the first quarter of Pushyami, Poorvashada and Chittra, 

the father of the native dies. If it be in the second quarter, the mother dies. The 

child will himself die if the birth takes place in the third quarter. The maternal 

131



uncle will die if the birth be in the fourth quarter of these nakshatra.

If the Ascendant is not connected with benefic planets and birth takes place 

in Moola or Ashlesha nakshatras the results will be as follows:—

Moola first Ashlesha fourth Death of the 
quarter quarter father 
Moola second Ashlesha third Death of the 
quarter quarter mother 
Moola third Ashlesha Extinction of 
quarter second quarter the family 
Moola fourth Ashlesha first Wealthy and 
quarter quarter prosperous. 

9. If the birth takes place at the time of Sandhi (junction) of the signs and if 

the signs be not aspected by or associated with  benefics the child born dies soon 

after birth.

If the birth occurs in Gandanta the death takes place either of the parents or 

the native himself. If, however, the native survives he becomes splendourous like a 

king (The sandhis between Pisces and Aries,  Cancer and Leo and Scorpio and 

Sagittarius are called gandanta). The person, who is born in Sandhi associated with 

or aspected by malefics will not see Sunrise. The same result may be expected if 

the Moon at birth attains tne fateful degree in any sign and is at the same time 

posited in a Kendra or the 8th house.

10.  Jf  the  degrees  attained  by  the  Moon in  Aries  and the  other  sign  be 

respectively 26, 12, 13, 25, 24, 11, 26, 14, 13, 25, 5 and 12, they indicate death.

11. The following are (also) respectively deemed as Mrityubhagas or fateful 

degrees of the Lagna in the several signs from Aries onwards 8, 9, 22, 22, 25, 14, 

4, 23, 18, 20, 21, and 10.

12.  The  child  born  dies  soon  after  birth  in  the  following  planetary 

dispositions :—

(1) If malefics be in the Kendra or the 8th.

(2) If the Ascendant and the 8th are occupied by malefics.

132



(3) If the Ascendant and the 7th are occupied by malefics.

(4) If the Moon and the Ascendant be hemmed in between malefics.

(5) If the waning Moon be posited in 6th, 8th or 12th.

(6) If the waning Moon alongwith malefics occupies the 1st, 5th, 7th or the 

9th house.

(7) If the malefics be posited in the 7th and 8th houses.

If, however, there be aspect of benefics on the Lagna, the Moon or malefics 

or there be benefics in Kendra, the evil effects described above do not come to 

pass.

13. If the lord of the Ascendant or the lord of the sign occupied by the Moon 

being weak is placed in 6th, 8th or 12th, the native survives for the number of the 

years as are indicated by the number of the sign (counted from Aries) in which the 

Lord of Lagna or the lord of the Moon sign is posited.

If the lord of the Lagna decanate or the lord of the Moon decanate being 

weak be placed in the 6th, 8th or 12th, the number of the sign in which such lord is 

posited will indicate the number of days of the survival of the child.

If the lord of the Lagna Navamsa or the lord of the Moon Navamsa being 

weak be placed in 6th, 8th or. 12th, the sign of the Lagna Navamsa or the Moon 

Navamsa will indicate the number of days of the survival of the native.

After carefully taking into account which of the above planetary dispositions 

are more predominant and after considering the nature of the malefics occupying 

the 5th and 8th house from the Lagna, a final decision should be taken about the 

longevity of the native.

14. Note the following 3 pairs (A) the decanate signs of the Lagna and the 

Moon.  (B)  the  Navamsa  signs  of  the  lord  of  the  Lagna  and  lord  of  the  sign 

occupied by the Moon and (C) the Dwadasasma signs of the lord of the Lagna and 

of the lord of the 8th house.

The life of the child should be pronounced as Deergha, Madhya and Alpa 

according as (a) when one of the signs in the said 3 pairs is a moveable sign and 

the other is a moveable fixed or dual sign, (b) when one of the signs is fixed and 

133



the other is a dual, moveable or fixed sign and (c) when one of the signs is a dual 

sign and the other is a fixed, dual or moveable sign respectively.

A 
Lagna Decanate sign Moon Decanate sign 
B 
Sign of the Lagna Sign of the Moon's 
Navamsa Navamsa 
C 
Dwadasamsa sign of the Dwadasamsa sign of 
lord of the Lagna. the lord of 8th.

15. If the lord of the Lagna and all the benefics be in Kendra the native will 

have Deerghayu

If they be in Panphara house the native will have Madhyayu.

If they be in Apoklima house, the native will have Alpayu.

If the lord of the 8th house and all malefics be posited in Kendra house the 

native will have Alphyu.

If they be posited in Panaphara house, the native will have Madhyayu.

If they be posited in Apoklima house, the native will enjoy Deerghayu.

Find out if the following 3 pairs of planets are mutualy friends, neutrals or 

enemies:—

(a) The lord of the sign in which the Moon is posited and the lord of the 8th 

house from the Moon sign.

134



(b) The lord of the Lagna and the lord of the 8th house.

(c) The lord of the Lagna and the Sun.

The native will enjoy Deerghayu if they are mutually friends. He will have 

Madhyayu if they are mutually neutrals and will have Alpayu if they are mutually 

enemies.

16. The native will be longlived (enjoy Deerghayu) if —

(1) The lord of the Lagna be stronger than the lord of the 8th house,

(2) The lord of the rising Navamsa be stronger than the lord of the 8th from 

Navamsa Lagna,

(3) If the lord of the sign occupied by the Moon be stronger than the lord of 

the 8th from the Moon,

(4) If the lord of the Moon's Navamsa be stronger than Ihe lord of the 8th 

from it.

If otherwise, the reverse will be the result.

17. If the lord of the 8th house endowed with greater strength than the lord 

of the lagna, be posited in Kendra and malefics occupy the 8th and the 12th, the 

native will be shortlived even if he gets medicum life or prolog his life to the full 

period, his life will be the vicissitudes of happiness and misery.

18.  Add  the  longitudes  of  the  Sun,  the  Moon,  Jupiter  and  Saturn.  For 

example the following are the longitudes given in a horoscope.

Sun - 7-26, Moon - 11-20, Jupiter - 6-14, Saturn - 0-17, 26 or 2-7 that 7 

degrees of Gemini.

If the native has alpayu the end of his life will come when Saturn in transit 

reaches the first cycle of 7 degrees of Gemini.

19. If the lord of the Lagna be associated with a maleifc and be eclipsed by 

the Sun's rays, or be in his sign of debilitation or in an inimical sign, the death of 

the native will have to be pronounced, when the same lord in his transit happens to 

occupy the 6th, 8th or 12th or the Lagna or be some how connected with it. The 

same event may also be deduced from the Navamsa Lagna, the decanate Lagna or 

the sign in which the Moon be posited.

135



20. If the Moon, the lord of the sign occupied by her and the lord of the 

Lagna be all well  placed by being associated with or aspected by benefics and 

passed  many  points  of  strength,  the  birth  at  that  time  should  be  treated  very 

auspicious and will make* the native happy in every way.

21. If the lord of the Lagna possesses great strength and be unaspected by 

(or  associated with)  malefics and be aspected by (or  associated with)  benefics, 

occupies a kendra house, the death is warded off and the native secures a long life 

with good qualities, wealth and an illusttrious or powerful sovereignty

22. If Jupiter,  the Minister of Gods, possessed of great strength and with 

brilliant rays be posited in Lagna, he can singly ward off many of the evils which 

otherwise would be difficult to overcome, just as a humble salutation placed with 

all sincerity before lord Vishnu demolishes all evils.

23. If the birth be in bright half of the lumar month (Shukla Paksha) and the 

Moon  be  posited  in  1st,  4th,  5th,  7th,  9th,  10th  or  the  11th  in  Cancer,  Leo, 

Sagittarius  or  Pisces  Navamsa,  many  evils  endangering  life  of  the  native  are 

demolished and the birth becomes very auspicious.

24. If in any nativity, there be no malefics in kendra, trikona and the 8th 

house and the lord of Lagna and Jupiter posited in kendra, the native performs 

virtuous actions, enjoys all kinds of happiness and remains in good health with a 

life span of 100 years.

25.  Through  the  Dasas  enunciated  by  Spripati,  through  Ashtakavarga, 

through Kalachakra  Dasa and through the  Vimsottari  Dasa  system,  a  Wiseman 

ought  to  predict  the  longevity  of  the  native  by following suitable  rules  after  a 

correct  calculation  of  several  planetary  positions,  careful  working  and  minute 

scrutiny.

Thus ends the thirteenth chapter on "Life Span" in Phaladeepika composed 

by Mantreswara.

10. If the Moon and the Sun occupied the 2nd and 12th houses associated 

with or aspected by Mars and Saturn, the native will suffer from eye diseases.

Notes - If the planetary disposition described above is concerned with the 

12th house, the left eye will be affected. Similarly if any amongst the Sun and the 

Moon is posited in the 2nd or the 12th house and is aspected by Saturn or Mars, 

such Sun or Moon is in the 2nd house, the right eye will get afflicted. The left eye 

will be adversely affected if their disposition be in the 12th house. If the Sun be in 

the 2nd aspected by or associated with Mars or Saturn and the Moon be in the 12th 

aspected by or associated with Mars or Saturn, both the eyes will get afflicted and 

may even make the native blind.

If the 3rd and 11th houses and Jupiter be associated with or aspected by 

Mars or Saturn, the native will suffer from diseases of the ears.

The native will suffer from stomach ache if the Mars be posited in the 5th 

house and be associated with the lord of the 6th or the 8th house.

Rectal disease, will be caused to the native if the lords of the 6th or the 8th 

house be posited in the 7th with a malefic or the lord of the 6th be in the 8th 

alongwith a malefic.

Venus under the above condition will make the native suffer from a disease 

in the private parts (veneral diseases).

11. If the 6th or 8th house be occupied by the Sun, there would be fear of 

fever, if by Mars or Ketu, the danger will be from injury or ulcer; if by Venus, it 

139



will be through a disease in the private parts, if Jupiter should occupy the 6th or the 

8th house, the native will be afflicted with consumption; if Saturn be in such a 

position, the native will suffer from nervous diseases. If Rahu aspected by Mars be 

in the 6th or  the  8th,  the  person concerned will  suffer  from carbuncle.  Should 

Saturn  alongwith  the  Moon  posited  in  6th  or  the  8th,  native  will  suffer  from 

enlargement of the spleen. If the waning Moon should occupy the 6th or the 8th 

house  identical  with  watery  sign,  in  conjunction  with  malefic;  the  person  will 

suffer from watery diseases or consumption.

12. I now proceed to explain the manner in which a person meets with his 

death and the cause of the same.

The death is  caused through the diseases  caused by the  strongest  of  the 

planets occupying or aspecting the 8th house.

If there be no planet occupying or aspecting the 8th house, the death will be 

caused by the diseases signified by the 8th house or those indicated by the house in 

which the lord of the 8th house is placed.

If  any of  the  planetary disposition do not  exist,  it  may be declared with 

certainty that death will be caused by the diseases caused by the lord of the 8th 

house, or by the lord of the 22nd decanate (counted from the Lagna decanate).

13. When the 8th house is occupied or aspected by a planet, death should be 

declared to be caused by diseases relating to that planet. When there are no planets 

occupying  or  aspecting the 8th house,  death is  caused through diseases arising 

from the nature of the sign representing the 8th house.

14-15. The diseases or means through which death is caused by the various 

planets are as under :—

(1) The Sun — fire, high fever, bile or weapon

(2) The Moon — Cholera, watery diseases or pulmonary disease

(3) Mars — fire, magical spells, witchcraft and weapons.

(4) Mercury—Anaemia, bloodlessness, and similar diseases and giddiness.

(5) Juipter — Causes death without much trouble or through phelgm.

(6) Venus — Venefal diseases or similar ones caused by association with 

140



Women.

(7) Saturn — Wind diseases or a dangerous fever like typhoid.

(8)  Rahu — Leprosy,  food poisoning,  venomous bites,  smallpox and the 

like.

(9) Ketu — Unnatural death like suicide, assassination as a result of hatred 

of enemies or through worms etc.

16. The death should be predicted through the evil effect arising from the 8th 

house reckoned from the Lagna or through the evil effect of the sign representing 

Navamsa occupied by the lord of the 8th house.

17-19.  The  diseases  caused  by  the  planets  have  already  been  described 

earlier.  Now are detailed the diseases and troubles caused by the various signs 

which may ultimately become the media of death of the native.

(1) Aries — fever due to excess of bile, diseases caused by heat like stroke 

etc., liver or gastric trouble.

(2) Taurus — Diseases caused by the imbalance of the three humours bile, 

phlegm and wind, injury by weapon or fire.

(3) Gemini — Catarrah, asthema, or sharp pain such as colic.

(4) Cancer — Insanity, windy diseases, loss of appetite etc.

(5) Leo — fatal injuries caused by wild animals, fever, boils, enemies.

(6) Virgo — Troubles caused by women, veneial diseases, fall from a height.

(7) Libra — Brain fever and typhod.

(8) Scorpio — Diseases of the spleen, dyspepsia and jaundice.

(9) Sagittarius — Injury caused by fall from a tree (or by tree falling of or 

varga

(10) Capricorn— Stomach-ache, loss or appetite or aberation of mind etc.

(11) Aquarius — cough, fever, consumption etc.

(12) Pisces — Watery diseases such as Jalodara, drowning, etc.

20. If the lord of the 8th house be a malefic and 8th house be a malefic the 

death will be by weapon, fire, tiger or snake.

If two malefics posited in kendras aspect each other, the death will be due to 

141



displeasure of the king, through a weapon, poison or fire.

21. If In any nativity, the lord of the 12th house be In a sign or Navamsa of a 

benefic or be associated with a benefic or the 12th house be occupied and owned 

by a benefic, the native will meet with his death without any anguish or suffering. 

The death will be painful if the lord of the 12th be posited in the sign or Navamsa 

of a malefic and be associated with a malefic,  or the 12th may'be occupied or 

owned by a malefic.

22. If the lord of 12th house be posited in his sign of exaltation, a friendly 

sign or a varga of a benefic planet or be associated with a benefic planet, the native 

after his death goes upwards to heaven. If he is posited in his sigh of debilition, in 

an inimical sign or in the varga of a malefic planet, he after his death goes to hell. 

Some interpret this as a result of the native of the sign (of the 12th house) i.e. 

heaven if the sign is a shirshodaya one and hell if it be a prishtodaya one.

Notes - Gemini, Virgo, Libra, Scorpio and Aquarius are Shirshodaya signs. 

Aries, Taurus, Cancer, Sagittarius and Capricorn are Prishtodaya signs. Pisces is an 

Ubhayodaya sign.

23. The refuge after death is indicated by (1) the planet or planets posited in 

the 12th house, (2) the planet occupying the Navamsa of the 12th house, or the 

palnet or planets with which the lord of the 12th be connected.

If the Sun or the Moon be such planet the abode of the soul after death will 

be Kailash. If Mars be the planet concerned, the native takes birth on the Earth 

immediately after death. If Mercury be the planet In question, the next world for 

the native will be Vaikuntha. Jupiter takes the native's soul to Brahmaloka, Saturn 

to the abode of Yama, Rahu to other islands and Ketu to hell.

24. It is from the lord of the 9th that all is ascertained about the native's past 

birth and all information about his future birth is signified by the lord of the 5th 

house. The particular caste, country and the direction of the person concerned in 

his past and future births should be deduced from the lords of the 9th and the 5th 

houses respectively.

25. If the planets referred to above be in their sign of exaltation, the abode 

142



should  be  declared  as  that  of  Gods  (Devaloka).  If  they  be  in  their  sign  of 

debilitation or in an inimical sign, the abodes of past and future birth should be 

declared to be foreign islands. If the above patents be in their own sign, friend's 

sign or a neutral's sign, such place would be India alone.

26. The parts of India covered by the various planets are as under:—

(1) The Sun — Mountains and forests.

(2) The Moon — Tracts watered by the holy rivers (like Ganga, Yamuna, 

Narmada, Godavari, etc.).

(3) Mars — Keekat Desha now known as Bihar.

(4) Mercury — All scared places.

(5) Jupfler—Aryavarta bordered in the North by Himalayas, in the South by 

Vindhya, and which extends to oceans in the East and the West

(6) Venus —The same places as have been indicated for the Moon.

(7)  Saturn  —  Prohibited  places  like  those  inhabited  by  Mlechhas  (non-

Hindus).

27. If the planets referred to in verse 24 (lords of the 9th and the 5th). are 

posited in a fixed sign or Navamsa which is Prishtodaya and Adhomukha along 

with malefics, the past and future briths of the native should be taken as trees, 

plants and the like. If the lords of the 9th and the 5th houses occupy a Shirshodaya 

and an Urdhvamukha sign or a moveable sign or navamsa, and be associated with 

benefics, the past and future birth will be of an animal kind.

28. If the lord of the 9th or the 5th be in the sign of exaltation or own sign 

the lord of the Lagna, it would mean that the native's previous or the future birth 

(as the case may be) will be that of a human being.

If the lord of the 9th occupied a sign neutral to the lord of the Lagna, the 

native in the past birth was born as an animal.

If the lord of the 5th be in a sign neutral to the lord of the Lagna. the native 

in his future birth will be born as an animal.

If the lord of the 9th occupies the sign of debilitation of the lord of the Lagna 

or in an inimical sign, the native was born as a bird in his previous birth.

143



If the lord of the 5th be in such a situation, the native will be born as a bird 

in his next birth.

All  these  may  also  be  declared  with  reference  to  the  appearance  of  the 

decanates occupied by the lord of the 9th or the 5th.

29. If the lords of the 9th and the 5th be in the same sign, the past birth was 

in his own country and the future birth will also take place there.

If these two planets be of equal strength, the past and future birth would be 

in the same caste.

The colour and quality will also be similar to these belonging to the lords of 

the 9th and the 5th houses.

Prediction regarding all the rest should be similarly made by a reference to 

what has been stated in the Samgnadhyaya.

Notes — What has been stated about past and future birth in Venus 21-29 

are  of  no  practical  utility  though  they  make  interesting  reading  because  it  is 

impossible to verify the correctness of such conclusions.

144



Chapter 15

Assessment of houses

1. The houses occupied and aspected by benefic planets or their own lords, 

or  planets  owning  auspicious  houses  produce  completely  beneficiary  results 

provided that they are not associated with or aspected by malefics. The same will 

be the result in the case of malefics if they happen to be lords of such houses. 

These good effects will be ensured in the case of all the planets when they are in 

the signs of debilitation, combust and in inimical signs.

2. It is the view of learned Astrologers that the strength of a house such as 

the Lagna should be adequate and the house sufficiently beneficial if the 1st, 2nd, 

4th, 5th, 7th, 9th and 10th from that house are occupied by auspicious planets or 

the lord of the house is free from the occupation by and aspect of malefics. The 

house concerned should be considered to  deteriorate  in its  effects  if  the  above 

houses  are  not  so  occupied  and  aspected.  The  effects  will  be  mixed  if  such 

positions are influenced by occupation or aspect by both benefics and malefics.

3. If the lord of a house be (1) posited in the 8th house, (2) eclipsed by the 

Sun's rays, (3) in his sign of debilitation or (4) in an inimical sign and be devoid of 

association or aspect of benefics, the effects of that house are totally destroyed. 

Some are of the view that the house in question will also suffer if its lord is in the 

8th from the Lagna also.

If any benefic being in his sign of debilitation, is in inimical sign or combust 

occupied any house, unaspected by any oenefic, he will destroy the good effects of 

the house owned by him. If a malefic being in his sign of debilitaton, combust or in 

his inimical sign unaspected by any benefic will harm the effects of that house. For 

example see the horoscope —

Here Mars occupies the 5th in his sign of debilitation. Inspite of the aspect 

of Jupiter on Mars on the 5th house the native lost two sons and himself suffered 

from a serious disease Jalodara.

4.  Malefic  occupying  the  6th,  8th  and 12th  house  with  reference  to  the 

Lagna or other house under examination cause the destruction of that house.

Notes—For example we have to assess the effects of the 7th house under 

examination. They are not capable of producing good effects of that house.

X L X

X 7th

For example, we have the 7th house under consideration. Suppose Jupiter is 

posited in the 6th or 8th or 12th from the 7th house. In such a position Jupiter will 

not be capable of any strength to the 7th house as from any of these places he will 

be unable to aspect the 7th house.

146



5. If the lord of the house under examination is in the 6th, 8th or 12th from 

the Lagna, that house is destroyed. The same will be the results if that house is 

occupied by the Lords of the 6th. 8th or 12th. The house concerned will, however, 

flourish if it is aspected by a benefic.

6. A house suffers annihilation in the following circumstances :—

(1) If the house, its lord and karaka be bereft of strength.

(2) If the house, its lord and karaka are hemmed in between malefics or be 

associated with or aspected by malefics and be devoid of any influence of benefics.

(3) If malefics occupy the 4th, 5th, 8th, 9th and 12th houses from that house.

There will be no doubt about the annihilation of the house if any of the two 

or three conditions' mentioned above synchronise.

Notes  — For  example,  in  a  male's  nativity  we have  to  examine the  7th 

house. If the 7th house be without any strength, the lord of 7th be posited betwixt 

malefics, and malefics occupy the 4th and 8th house from Venus, the first wife of 

the native will definitely meet with her death.

7. If the lord of the 8th house, the lord of 22nd decanate and lords of 6th, 7th 

and 8th from a house be without strength, they will cause harm to the house (its 

effects) in their dasa, and antar dasa.

A house will flourish in the dasa of the following planets :—

(1) Malefics posited in the 3rd, 6th and 11th from that house.

(2) Benefits posited in the 1st, 4th, 5th, 7th, 9th, and 10th from that house.

(3) Planets which are friendly to the lord of that hosue.

Provided that the planets mentioned above are not devoid of strength.

Notes — For example see the following horoscope — Here if we examine 

the position of the Lagna we will find that Saturn is an enemy of the Sun (lord of 

the Lagna). Therefore there will be physical distress in the dasa and antar dasa of 

Saturn. Jupiter is a friend of the Sun. Therefore there will be physical felicity in the 

dasa and antar dasa of Jupiter.

147

8. The following planets in their dasa and antar dasa cause destruction of the 

house.

(1) The lord of the 3rd house from the Lagna

(2) The lord of the 3rd house from the Moon

(3) The planet occupying the 8th house.

(4) The planet which aspects the 8th house.

(5) Saturn

(6) The lord of the 22nd decanate

(7) The lord of the house occupied by Mandi,

(8)  The lord  of  the  sign and navamsa in  which  the  above 7  planets  are 

posited.

(9) Rahu, if he be weak by occupying the 8th or 12th house or by being 

associated with or aspected by madefies.

Notes — In this verse it has not been made clear which house will become 

the victim of destruction but in the previous verse it has been stated that houses 

occupied by malefics, those surrounded on both sides by malefics, get damaged. 

The same principle should apply to this verse.

9. Whichever house is occupied by the lord of the Lagna gains in prosperity 

and well being i.e. it becomes very beneficient and produces very good effects.

The  good  effects  of  only  such  houses  are  enhanced  if  their  lords  are

associated with or aspected by the lord of the Lagna.

If the lord of any house is posited in dusthana (6th, 8th or 12th), the effects 

will be reverse. If the planet in the dusthana be weak, the effects will be immensely 

harmful. If he is strong the damage will be slight.

10. In spite of the lord of Lagna being malefic, he will improve the prospects 

of the house occupied by him. In addition to being the lord of the Lagna, if a planet 

happens to own a dusthana (6th, 8th or 12th), the effects of his ownership of Lagna 

only will prevail and not that of the other house.

For example, Mars owning the Lagna occupy Leo (Aries being the Lagna) 

or Pisces (Scorpio being the Lagna) identical with the 5th house and be aspected 

by a benefic, the person concerned will get sons very soon.

Sun 
L Merc

Venus

Rahu Moon

Mars 
Sat Jupt

Ketu

For example see the horoscope. Here Mars as the lord of Lagna and the 8th 

occupies the 5th house with Jupiter and Ketu. In spite of Ketu the native is blessed 

with sons and daughters.

11. Should a planet own two houses, the effects of the house which is the 

Moolatrikona will predominate while the effects of his own house will be half.

Notes — For example in a nativity of Leo Lagna Jupiter will be lord of the 

5th and the 8th house. The 5th is an auspicious house and the 8th house is evil. As 

Jupiter Moolatrikona (Sagittarius) falls in the 5th house, he will produce the effects 
149



of the lord of the 5th predominantly and his effects as the lord of the 8th will be 

half.

In the dasa of such a planet the effects of both the ownerships will come to 

pass (good and bad both). The effects of first sign counted from the Lagna will be 

experienced first and the effects of the other sign will be derived later. This is one 

view. The other view is that a planet posited in an odd sign will produce the effect 

of that house first while the one that occupies an even sign will have its effect 

experiened in the second half of the dasa.

12.  The distinction  of  a  house  from the  Lagna onwards  during the  dasa 

period of planets which are very inimical (adhishatru) of the lord of that house or 

which occupy houses where there are no benefic dots in their ashtakavargas.

Notes  — Suppose,  the  maha  dasa  of  Saturn  is  in  operation  and  in  the 

Saturn's ashtakavarga there are no benefic dots in the 5th house. Thus in the dasa 

and an tar dasda of Saturn, the 5th house will be damaged and produce evil effects. 

The  another  view  in  this  regard:  Suppose  the  Lagna  is  Leo  and  in  the  Sun's 

ashtakavarga there are no benefic dots in Pisces in their dasa and antar dasa will 

cause physical distress (by damaging the Lagna). According to this view, if in the 

ashtakavarga of the lord of the house under examination, the planet occupying the 

sign which has no benefic dots, will harm the house concerned in his dasa and 

antar dasa.

13. Even if a planet be posited in his sign of exaltation or a friendly sign or 

be enjoying the six kinds of strength (shadabala), he proves in affliction if he is 

situated in Bhava-Sandhi (junction of two houses). This must be taken into account 

while predicting the effects of dasas and antar dasas of planets.

14.  In  the  case  of  various  houses,  the  planets  occupy  the  exact  degrees 

(Bhava-Madhya) signified by any particular house, produce the full effects of that 

house.  The planets situated in Bhava-Sandhi  produce no effects.  In the case of 

planets  occupying  intermediate  positions,  the  effects  must  be  ascertained  by  a 

method of three processes.

15. Ascertainment about his ownself, father, influence, health, vitality and 

150



fortune be made from the Sun. The Moon signifies the native's character of heart, 

understanding,  royal  favour,  mother  and  prosperity.  From  Mars  one  should 

ascertain  his  own  courage,  disease,  characteristic,  qualities,  younger  brothers, 

lands, enemies and paternal blood relations. Mercury is concerned with learning, 

relatives in general, discrimination, maternal uncle, friends, and speech.

16.  The  native  should  ascertain  about  his  genius,  wealth,  physical 

development,  sons  and  knowledge  through  Jupiter.  One  should  seek  the 

jurisdiction of Venus to know about his wife, vehicles, ornaments, love affairs and 

pleasures from spouse. Saturn will furnish information about native's span of life, 

livelihood,  the  cause  of  death,  his  adversity  and  his  servants.  Rahu  signifies 

paternal grand-father and Ketu maternal grand-father.

17.  The  signification  of  the  kanaka  of  the  houses  commencing  from the 

Lagna are (1) the Sun, (2) Jupiter, (3) Mars, (4) the Moon and Mercury, (5) Jupiter, 

(6) Venus, (7) Saturn, (8) the Sun and Jupiter, (9) Jupiter, the Sun, Mercury and 

Saturn, (10) Jupiter and (11) Saturn.

18. If one is to assess the effects of a planet, he should carefully note in 

which of the 12 houses beginning with the Lagna, he is posited and whether it is 

his  own  sign,  his  sign  of  exaltation,  his  friend's  sign  or  is  an  inimical  sign. 

According to Satyacharya, the benefics occupying a house promote its growth and 

the malefics so posited cause the decay of the house. This is reversed in the case of 

the 6th, 8th and 12th houses.

19.  If  malefics  occupy  the 6th,  8th  or  12th  house  from the Lagna,  they 

intensify  the  evil  effects  of  those  houses.  Benefics  in  these  houses  cause  the 

destruction of these houses.  In other words the evil  effects arising out of these 

houses are destroyed.

Notes — Although according to Shri Mantreshwara, the benefics destroy or 

alleviate the evil effects of the 6th, 8th and 12th houses but being posited there 

they themselves get afflicted and harm the houses they own arid do not produce 

beneficial results in their dasas and antar dasas.

20. In order to assess or judge the effects of a house in the case of nativity, 

151



that house should be treated as the Lagna and the effects of 12 houses reckoned 

from there such as, (first form, 2nd wealth) should be examined and declared.

Notes: According to the principle mentioned above if we have to consider 

about the wife of the son, we will treat the 5th house as Lagna and the 7th house 

from it,  that is the 11th, will signify the wife of the son. Similarly we have to 

examine about the wife's wealth, the 7th house should be treated as the Lagna and 

the 2nd from the 7th, that is, 8th house will be the house of wealth for the wife on 

the same basis about the younger brother's wife we will have to ascertain from the 

9th house.

21.  In  the  same manner  should the  effects  of  the  father,  the  mother,  the 

brother, the maternal uncle, the son, the husband and the servant be determined by 

treating the signs occupied by their respective Karakas. The meaning of this is that 

if  the effects of  the father are to be determined,  the sign occupied by the Sun 

should be treated as the Lagna and the second from that sign all information of the 

father's brother and the 3rd about mother's brother and so on. For effects of the 

mother  the  sign occupied by the  Moon,  for  the  effects  of  the  brother  the  sign 

occupied by Mercury, for the effects of the son, the sign occupied by Jupiter, for 

the effects of wife the sign occupied by Venus, for the effects of servant the sign 

occupied by Saturn, have to be treated as the Lagna.

22 -  24 From the sign occupied  by  the  Sun one ought  to  determine the 

appearance of the father of the native. The father's financial position and renown 

should be ascertained from the 2nd house from the sign occupied by the Sun. His 

character, brothers etc., should be examined from the 3rd house from that occupied 

by the Sun. The 4th house reckoned from the Sun will  give information about 

father's happiness and his mother. The intelligence and tranquility of the father has 

to be determined from the 5th house, his differences, enemies and disease from the 

6th house, his love and passion from the 7th house, his longevity and death from 

the  8th  house,  his  virtues,  wealth,  father's  father  from  the  9th  house,  his 

professional pursuits from the 10th house, his financial gains from the 11th house 

and his losses and expenditure from the 12th house from the sign occupied by the 

152



Sun.

In the same manner, all matters relating to the mother and brother should be 

determined from the signs respectively occupied by the Moon and Mars.  From 

Mercury  and  other  planets  the  assessment  of  the  12th  house  from  the  signs 

occupied by them should be similarly undertaken.

25. Thus all details about the father, mother, brother, son etc., of a house 

should  be  determined  by  a  reference  to  the  Bhava  concerned,  its  lord  and  its 

Karaka. When any house, its lord and its Karaka are all strong, the prosperity of 

that house is definite.

26. But the others say that the Sun in the 9th, the Moon in the 4th, Mars in 

the third, Jupiter in the 5th, Venus in the 7th, and Saturn in the 8th will cause 

distress to the houses concerned.

27.  The lord  of  the  Lagna produces  effects  pertaining  to  the  house with 

whose lord he is conjoined or the one occupied by him. If the house and its lord be 

strong good results may be expected from the house. If they are weak the results 

will be adverse.

28.  Whatever  houses  contain  longer  number  of  benefic  dots  in  the 

Ashtakavarga of the lord of the Lagna and if the lords of the houses concerned 

were strong and be conjoined with the lord of the Lagna, those house will produce 

beneficial  result.  If  however,  the  houses  concerned  contain  lesser  number  of 

benefic dotes and their lords be devoid of strength and be associated with the lord 

of the Lagna, those houses will not produce any benefic results. An Assessment of 

all the houses should be made in this manner.

29. If a planet owns two signs one of which falls In an asuspicious position 

from the Lagna and the other in a dusth one (6th, 8th or 12th), and if he occupies 

the auspicious sign himself he produces good results of the auspicious houses and 

does not produce any adverse effects of the other signs falling in a dusthana.

Notes—For example—Virgo Is the Lagna. Saturn occupies the 5th house 

Identical with the sign Capricorn. Although Saturn's other sign Aquarius falls in the 

6th house (a dusthan), he will produce good results of the 5th house only and the 

153



native will be blessed with children.

30. The following are the five recognised connections or relations between 

two planets —

(1) When they occupy mutually each other's sign.

(2) When they are conjoined.

(3) When there is mutual aspect between them.

(4) When they are in Kendra position with respect to each other.

(5) When they are in Trikona position with reference to each other.

Thus ends the fifteenth chapter on "The Effects oJBhavas in Phaladeepika  

composed by Mantreswara.

Chapter 16

General Effects of the Twelve Houses

1. The body of the native is built corresponding to the lord of the Navamsa 

Lagna or the strongest planet in nativity. His complexion will be according to the 

lord of the house occupied by the Moon. His body and limbs will be in propotion 

to the rising sign (Lagna) and other signs which are described as forming the head 

and other portions of Kalapurusha.

2. If the lord of the Lagna occupies a kendra or trikona, be uneclipsed and in 

his sign of exaltation or own sign and the Lagna be occupied by benefics, while the 

lord of  the 8th be in a house other  than kendra,  the native will  be long lived, 

wealthy,  praiseworthy,  equipped  with  virtues,  honoured  by  the  king,  fortunate, 

possesses beautiful limbs and strong body, fearless, religious minded and having a 

happy family.

3. If the lord of Lagna be related to an auspicious planet,  the native will 

reside in a good village and amidst noble associations. If the lord of the Lagna be 

associated  with  a  planet  vested  with  strength,  the  native  will  live  under  the 

patronage of a renowned king.

When the lord of Lagna be posited in his sign of exaltation, the person will 

become a king (but he should not be in 6th, 8th, or 12th).

If the lord of the Lagna be in a moveable sign, the native will contiune to 

move from place to place.

If the lord of the lagna be in a fixed sign, the native will live permanently at 

one place.

If the lord of the Lagna be in a dual sign, the native will live for some time 

at one place while at other times he will move from place to place.

4. If at birth, the lord of Lagna be with brilliant rays, the native becomes 

famous. If the lord of Lagna occupies an auspicious position, the native will be 

happy and prosperous. If, however, the lord of Lagna be placed in a dusthana, be in 

his sign of debilitation or in the sign of a malefic, the native will be miserable and 

155



live in an undesirable place.

If  the  lord  of  Lagna  be  equipped  with  strentgth  and  be  posited  in  an 

auspicious house, the native will be happy, valiant, prosperous and will come to 

power and prominence.

If the lord of the Lagna be devoid of strength, the native will be constantly 

overcome by calamities, be unhappy and will lead a sickly life.

5. If the lord of the 2nd house be posited in the Lagna while the 2nd house 

be occupied by benefics, the native will be equipped with the best of qualities, 

wealth, with a handsome face and farsighted and will have a prosperous family.

If the lord of the 2nd be connectd with or related to the Sun, the native will 

be wealthy and utilise his wealth for the good of the whole humanity.

If the lord of the 2nd be related to Saturn, the person concerned will  be 

bereft of learning or it will be of a very low order.

6. If the lord of the 2nd be connected with Jupiter, the native will be well 

versed  in  the  Vedas  and  the  sacred  scriptures.  If  Mercury  be  the  Planet  so 

associated, the native will specialise in economics and allied subjects, with Venus 

as the associate the native will be expert In amorous topics. When the lord of the 

2nd is connected with Moon, the person concerned will be clever in some kinds of 

arts. When connected with Mars, the native will be adapt in tasks involving cruelty 

and he will be a back-biter. If the planet asociated with the lord of the 2nd be Rahu, 

the native will be stammering. If he be Ketu, the person concerned will stammer 

and speak falsehood.

If  malefics  occupy the 2nd house,  the  native  will  be a  fool  and without 

wealth.

7. If the lord of the 3rd and the lord of the Lagna be connected with each 

other  by  mutual  exchange  of  places,  the  native  will  be  capable  of  performing 

daring acts, patient, volorous and will be affectionate towards his brothers.

8. If the lord of the 3rd house be equipped with strength, be conjoined with a 

benefic and the karaka of the 3rd house be also strong and posited in a benefic 

house, the prosperity of brothers is assured. If, however, the lord of the 3rd and its 

156



karaka be weak and be posited in a dusthana,  the result  will  be destruction of 

brothers.

9. If the lord of the 3rd house and its karaka (Mars) be posited in odd signs 

and be aspected by Jupiter the Sun and Mars and the 3rd house also falling in an 

odd sign, the native will have as many brothers as revealed by the navamsa of both 

the karaka and the lord of the 3rd house.

10. Hie mother of the native dies soon after his birth if in any nativity, the 

lord  of  the  4th  and  the  Moon  be  posited  in  dusthana  unassociated  with  and 

unaspected by any benefics, or be hemmed in between malefics and be associated 

with or aspected by malefics. Should, however, the above two planets be strong, be 

associated with or aspected by benefics and a benefic occupies the 4th house, the 

mother's  happiness  is  assured.  Mother  will  also  live  happily  with  benefics  be 

posited in auspicious houses reckoned from the Moon.

11. The native will certainly perform the funeral rites of his mother if —

(1) The lord of the 4th be in the Lagna and the lord of Lagna be in the 4th.

(2) The Moon be aspected by the lord of either the lord of the Lagna or the 

lord of the 4th house.

The native will be unable to perform the funeral rites of his mother if the 

planetary dispositions be as under —

(i) If the lord of the Lagna and the lord of the 4th be in the 6th and the 8th 

with reference to each other or be in each other's sign of depression or inimical 

sign.

(ii) They may not be connected with each other in any way.

12. Just as the fourth house and its karate the Moon have been assessed for 

Judging the effects of the fourth house, assessment should be made in the same 

manner  in  respect  of  father,  brother,  sons  etc.,  by  taking  into  account  the 

circumstances of the house concerned, its karaka planets occupying the house, the 

lord of the house, connection of the planets with the Lagna and the lord of the 

Lagna.

Notes — If the Lagna and the lord of the Lagna be strong, there will be good 

157



relations between the 5th house, lord of the 5th house and Jupiter, there will be 

mutual affection between the native and his sons and the sons will be happy and 

prosperous. If the lord of the Lagna and the lord of the 5th be mutual enemies and 

be  6th  and  8th  to  each  other  and  be  in  each  other's  inimical  sign  or  sign  of 

debilitation, the effects will be quite the opposite.

13. If the lord of the 4th or Venus be well placed in the Lagna or the 4th 

house  (and  be  uneclipsed  in  signs  of  their  debilitation),  the  native  enjoys  the 

honour  of  riding a  palanquin,  he becomes 4 lord  or  a  king and acquires  gold, 

valuable ornaments, conch, silk, cow, items of luxuries, elephants, horses, etc.

14. If the lord of the 4th house be In dusthana (6th, 8th or 12th) or associated 

with the Sun and Mars or the Sun and Mars be in the 4th house, the house in which 

the native was born will be burnt. If the lord of 4th be in the 4th with Rahu and 

Saturn, the house will be old and dilapidated. If there will be an inimical planet in 

the  4th,  native's  belongings  such  as  cow  s,  lands  vehicles,  etc.,  will  be 

misappropriated by others.

15. If the 5th house be in a benefic sign and in the navamsa of a benefic, the 

native will be intelligent and open hearted. The same will be the result if the lord of 

5th be posited in an auspicious house and has attained Vaisheishikamsa.

16. (1) Malefics in the 6th, (2) the lord of the Lagna in association With or 

aspected by a strong lord of the 6th. (3) the lord of the Lagna posited in the 6th, (4) 

the  lord  of  the  6th  posited  in  a  kendra  house  and  (5)  the  lord  of  the  6th  in 

conjunction  with  or  aspected  by  malefics,  will  cause  the  native  immense  and 

constant harrassment for which there will be no remedies.

17. If the lord of the Lagna be much stronger than the lord of the 6th, be in 

the sign or navamsa of a benefic and be aspected by benefics, and a strong lord of 

4th occupies a kendra or trikona, the native will be hale and healthy, will not suffer 

from any disease and will be fortunate.

18. If the lord of the 6th be in the 6th in his sign of depression, in an inimical 

sign and eclipsed by Sun's rays, and the lord of the Lagna be stronger than the lord 

of the 6th with the Sun in the 9th, the native destroys his enemies.

158



Notes — There is another version of this verse according to which, it will 

read as (...). If this version is adopted it will mean that instead of Sun being in the 

9th, there would be benefic in the 6th.

We would also like to mention that the lord of the 6th in 6th can never be in 

a sign of depression or an inimical sign. He will always in his own sign. He can, 

however, be eclipsed by Sun's rays.

19. (1) The house, the lord of which is associated with the lord of the 6th. (2) 

the house occupied by the lord of the 6th. and (3) the house, the lord of which is 

posited in the 6th. these will always be inimical to the native.

Notes — For example if the lord of 6th is posited in the 5th, the lord of the 

5th is in the 6th or the lords of the 5th and 6th be together in any house, his son 

will be inimical towards the native.

20. If the 7th house be connected with benefics and the lord of the 7th be 

well equipped with strength, the wife of the native will be devoted to her husband, 

will be full of virtues and good qualities and will be blessed with sons (children).

21. If in any nativity the lord of the 8th house be posited in any house other 

than a kendra and the lord of the 8th be weaker than the lord of the Lagna, the 

native will be longlived and will be free from all kinds of anxieties, obstacles and 

miseries.

22. If the Sun or Mars be in the 9th and the lord of the 9th be in a dusthana 

(6th, 8th or 12th) or be hemmed in between malefics, the father dies soon after the 

native's birth.

Notes — If the death does not take place immediately, if will take place in 

the dasa antar dasa of the Sun or Mars.

23. If the Sun in the case of day birth and Saturn in the event of a night birth, 

be posited in an auspicious position and be connected with the benefics, and the 

lord of the 9th be strong, the father of the native will be longlived.

24. If the Sun and the Moon be in trine with Saturn and Mars, the native at 

birth will be abandoned by his parents but if the Sun and the Moon be graced by 

the aspect of Jupiter, the native will be longlived and happy.

159



25. If Saturn being lord of the 9th, be in a moveable sign unaspected by 

benefics and the Sun be in a dusthana, the native (the child born) is brought up by a 

person other than his father.

26. If the 9th house being in a moveable sign is associated with or aspected 

by Saturn and if the lord of the 12th house be strong, the child born is sure to be 

adopted by another.

27. If the 10th house be conjoined with a benefic and the lord of 10th with 

full strength be posited in a kendra or trikora identical with his own sign or his sign 

of exaltation, or if the lord of the Lagna equipped with strength be posited in the 

10th,  the  native  will  be  fortunate  like  a  king,  will  be  longlived  and  widely 

renowned and will perform virtuous actions.

28. If the 10th house is occupied by the Sun and Mars, the native will be a 

very influential  and mighty personage.  If  at  the same time lord of the 10th be 

posited  in  an  auspicious  position,  the  person  concerned  will  be  capable  of 

accomplishing great undertakings with much valour and heroism. If the 10th house 

be occupied by benefics he will undertake commendable ventures for the good of 

the people. But the native will indulge in nefarious activities if the 10th is occupied 

by Saturn, Rahu or Ketu.

29. Predict the acquisition or gain of articles connected with the (1) house 

the lord of which is conjoined with the lord of the 11th, (2) the house in which the 

lord of the 11th be posited and (3) the houses lords of which occupy the 11th.

Notes — For example the lord of the 11th is posited in the 5th, or the Jord of 

the  5th  occupies  the  11th,  or  the  lords  of  the  5th  and  the  11th  are  conjoined 

together,  with  such disposition of  the  lords  of  the 5th  and 11th,  the prediction 

should be that there will be gain or acquisition of learning and children and profit 

in speculation because these are all signified by the 5th house.

30. Predict loss of the articles or significations connected with the (1) house 

the lord of which occupies the 12th house and (2) the house in which the lord of 

the 12th be posited.

Notes — For example the lord of the 4th occupies the 12th. This will cause 

160



loss of vehicles and lands etc. If the 12th lord occupies the 5th, there may be loss 

of children, or loss in speculation etc.

Fructification of the houses

31. The acquisition or success of a house should be declared in the following 

situations :—

(1) When the lord of the Lagna passes in transit in trikona through the sign 

or navamsa occupied by the lord of the house.

(2) When the lord of the Lagna passes through that house in transit.

(3) When the lord of the house transits in the sign which is trikona to the 

sign or navamsa occupied by the lord of the Lagna.

(4) When in course of transit the lord of the Lagna and the lord of the house 

get conjoined or aspect each other.

(5) When the karaka of the house in course of his transit gets conjoined with 

the lord of the Lagna or the lord of the sign occupied by the Moon.

Similar  assessment  should be made from the sign in which the  Moon is 

posited (Chandra lagna).

32. Note the position of the sign or navamsa occupied by the lord of the 

house under consideration. When Jupiter, in course of his transit, is in trikona to 

that sign and navamsa,  the derivation of the good effects of the house may be 

expected.

33. When in the course of their transit the lord of the Lagna and the 6th 

house get into conjunction, the native will overcome his enemies, if the lord of the 

6th house is  weaker than the lord of the lagna.  If the lord of the 6th house is 

stronger than the lord of the Lagna, quite opposite will be the results.

34. If there be natural or temporal enimity between the lord of the lagna and 

the lord of a house or they be posited 6th and 8th to each other, enimity or jealousy 

will arise to the native with the person signified by that house, whenever the lord 

of the lagna and the house concerned get conjoined in the course of their transits. 

But if there is natural and temporal friendship between the lord of the lagna and the 

lord of the house in.question, there will be new friendships whenever the two lords 

161



conjoin in the course of their transits.

Notes — See the following horoscope as our example in this horoscope the 

lord of the Lagna is the Sun and the lord of the 6th is Saturn. Both are natural and 

temporal enemies and or in the 6th and 8th positions with respect to each other. 

Whenever the Sun and Saturn conjoin in course of their transits, the native will 

suffer on account of rivalries and enemities. Also note that the Sun is the lord of 

the lagna and Jupiter is the lord of the 5th. Both are natural and temporal friends. 

Good effects of 5th house should be derived when the Sun and Jupiter conjoin in 

course of their transits.

35. The success of the house under examination may be declared when the 

lord of the lagna gets into conjunction with the lord of that house in course of their 

transits provided that the lord of the house concerned is strong, otherwise the result 

will be different.

Similar assessment should be made with reference to the sign in which the 

Moon Is posited (Chandra lagna).

Chapter 17

Exit from the world

1. When Saturn in course of his transit passes through the sign and navamsa 

of the lord of 8th or the 12th with respect of any house, that house would be treated 

as having been destroyed. The same will happen when Saturn transits houses that 

are triangular to these two houses.

Saturn as the determinator of death

2. Find out the sign and navamsa occupied by (1) the lord of the 8th house, 

(2) Gulika, (3) Saturn or (4) the lord of the 22nd decanate (counted from that of the 

lagna). When in the course of his transit Saturn passes that sign or navamsa or its 

trikona position, death may take place of the native.

3.-4. The death of the native may take place when Jupiter in course of transit 

passes through the sign or navamsa occupied by any of the following three planets 

or their triangular position

(1) The lord of the decanate that is rising

(2) The lord of the 8th house

(3) The lord of the 22nd decanate

(4) Find out the position of

(i) Dwadasamsa sign of the Sun,

(ii) The navamsa of the lord of the 8th house

(iii) The .navamsa of the lord of the Lagna.

Jupiter or the Sun, when in course of his transit, passes through any of these 

signs or those triangular to them, the death of the native may take place.

Notes — In the above verses it has been indicated that the death may take 

place when Saturn,  Jupiter  and the Sun transit  certain  positions.  This  does not 

mean that death will definitely take place at the time specified as Saturn makes a 

full round of the Zodiac in 30 years, Jupiter in 12 years and the Sun in one year. 

The intention of indicating the eifects of these transits is that if the time of death 

may  have  to  be  determined during  the  dasa  of  a  maraka  planet,  these  transits 

163



should be taken into account.

5. The death of the native takes place when the Moon in course of his transit 

passes the sign occupied by the lord of the 8th or the Sun or a sign triangular to 

them.  All  that  has  been  stated  in  the  above  verses  should  be  examined  with 

reference to the Lagna as well as the sign occupied by the Moon (Chandra Lagna).

6. Subtract the longitude of Yamakantaka from the longitude of the lord of 

the Lagna, subtract the longitude of Saturn from that of the Moon. The death of the 

native will take place when Jupiter in the course of his transit passes through the 

sign  and  its  navamsa  indicated  by  each  of  these  differences  or  their  trikona 

position.

Subtract the longitude of Mars from that of Rahu. When Jupiter in the course 

of  his  transit  passes  through  the  navamsa  or  the  sign  thus  indicate  by  the 

difference, the death of the brother may take place.

7.  Subtract  the  longitude  of  the  Sun  from that  of  the  Yamakantaka,  the 

remainder may be marked as (A). When Jupiter in the course of his transit passes 

through the sign and navamsa indicated by (A) and the trikona position from it, the 

death of the native's father may take place.

Subtract  the  longitude  of  Mandi  or  Gulika  from  the  longitude  of  the 

Yamakantaka. Mark the difference as (A). When Jupiter in the course of his transit 

passes  the  sign or  navamsa  indication  or  its  trikona  position,  the  death  of  the 

native's father may take place.

Subtract the longitude of the Moon from that of the Sun and Mark it (B). 

When Saturn in the course of his transit passes through the sign and or navamsa 

indicated by (B) or the trikona position from them, the death of the native's mother 

may take place.

Subtract the longitude of Mandi from the longitude of the Moon and mark it 

(C). When Saturn in the course of his tranist passes through the sign or navamsa 

indicated  by  (C)  and the  trikona  position  from them, the  death  of  the  native's 

mother may take place.

8. Subtract the longitude of the lord of the nakshatra fifth from the Janma 

164



nakshatra,  the  longitude  of  the  Yamakantaka.  When  Jupiter  passes  through  in 

course of his transit, the sign or navamsa indicated by the difference or the trikona 

position from them, the death of the native's son may take place.

Determination of Native's Death

9. Add the longitudes of the Lagna, the Sun and Mandi. Find out the location 

of the lord of the sign indicated by the result. When Jupiter in the course of his 

transit  passes through the sign so occupied by such lord or the trikona position 

from it, the death of the native may take place.

10. Subtract the longitude of Saturn from that of Mars. When Saturn in the 

course of his transit passes through the sign or navamsa indicated by the difference 

or the trikona position from them, the death of the native may take place.

Add  the  longitudes  of  the  five  upagrahas  reckoned  from Dhuma.  When 

Saturn in the course of his transit passes through the particular drekkana or the sign 

indicated by the aggregate, the death of the native may take place.

11. Add the longitudes of the Lagna and Mandi. The rasi and its navamsa 

indicated by the aggregate will give clue to the particular month and the portion 

thereof in a year in which the death of the native may be expected to happen (i.e. 

When the Sun arrives at this particular sign and the particular navamsa thereof, the 

person will die).

Add the longitude of Mandi and the Moon. The Moon will be posited in the 

sign indicated by the aggregate at the time of death.

Add the longitudes of  the Lagna,  Mandi  and the Moon.  The sign of  the 

Lagna at the time of death, will be indicated by the sum total of the above three 

longitudes.

12. Find out the navamsa, the Dwadasmsa and drekkana indicated by the 

longitude of Mandi. The death of the native takes places when —

(1) Jupiter in course of his transit passes through the above navamsa.

(2) Saturn in course of the transit passes through the above dwadasamsa.

(3) The Sun in course of his transit passes through the above drekkana and 

the Trikona position from it, and the Lagna is the sign occupied by the lord of the 

165



sign denoted by the aggregate of the longitudes of the Lagna (at birth), the Moon 

and Mandi.

13. Multiply separately the longitudes of Mandi and Saturn by 9. Add both 

the results. When Saturn in course of his transit arrives at the Sign or navamsa 

indicated by the aggregate, the death of the native may take place.

14. Subtract the longitude of Yamakantaka from the Longitude of the Lagna. 

The death of the native will definitely take place when Jupiter in course of his 

transit arrives at the sign or navamsa indicated by the difference.

15. Add the longitudes of the lord of the 6th, 8th and 12th. The death of the 

native takes place when Saturn in course of his transit passes through the sign or 

navamsa indicated by the aggregate or in trikona position to them.

16. Find out the Drekkana of the Lagna and where the lord of that Drekkana 

is posited. There will be danger to the life of the native when Jupiter in course of 

his trainsit passes through this position or its trikona.

When Saturn transits the house owned by the lord of the Drekkana of the 8th 

house or its Trikona, the death of the native may take place.

17. Find the weakness of the following sets of planets—

(1) The lord of the 8th house from the Lagna and the lord of the 8th house 

from the Moon.

(2) The lords of the 22nd decanate from the Lagna and the Moon.

(3) The Moon and Mandi.

When Saturn in the course of his transit passes through the navamsa of the 

weakest amongst them or his trikona, the death of the native may take place.

18. See the navamsa in which the lord of the Lagna is posited. Mark it as 

(A). Similarly mark the sign of the lord of 8th house as (B). When Saturn in the 

course of his transit passes through the sign as far away from (B) as is (A) from 

Aries,  the  death of  the  native  may take  place.  This  is  the  view of  the  learned 

Astrologers who are also versed in many Shastras.

19. Death may also take place when the Moon in the course of her transit 

passes through the house occupied by the lord of 22nd decanate counted from that 

166



of the Moon at the time of birth or its trikona position or through the Lagna sign, 

the 8th house or the 12th house.

20. The death of the native may take place when

(1) The Sun in the course of his transit passes through the sign occupied by 

the lord of the 8th house.

(2) The Moon in the course of her transit passes through thesign occupied by 

the Sun or through the nakshatra occupied by the lord of the 8th house.

21. If it is a case of night birth find out in which sign Gulika is posited. The 

death of  the native takes place when Saturn in the course of  his transit  passes 

through the trikona position of that sign. In the case of day birth the death of the 

native may take place when Saturn in the course of his transit passes through the 

sign 7th to that occupied by Gulika.

22. Add the longitudes of Jupiter and Rahu. The native will face danger of 

death when Jupiter in the course of his transit passes through the sign denoted by 

the sum of the two longitudes or its trikona position.

23. The death of the native takes place when Saturn in the course of his 

transit passes through the house occupied by the lord of the decanate of the 8th 

house.

The death of the native may also take place when Saturn in the course of his 

transit  passes through the navamsa sign occupied by the lord of the 8th house 

reckoned from the Lagna.

24. There is likelihood of the death of the native when Saturn in the course 

of his transit passes through the sign and navamsa occupied by him at birth or its 

trines.

The  same  may  happen  when  Saturn  in  the  course  of  his  transit  passes 

through the sign or navamsa occupied by the lord of sign in which the Moon is 

posited or its trines.

Death of the native may also take place when Saturn in the course of his 

transit passes through the sign or navamsa occupied by the lord of the 6th from the 

Lagna and its trines.

167



25. In the case of a night birth death of the native may happen when Saturn 

in the course of his transit passes through the sign or navamsa occupied by the 

Moon or the Mandi.

In the case of a day birth,  the death may take place when Saturn in the 

course of his transit passes through the sign occupied by the Sun or through the 

5th, 7th, or 9th from the position occupied by the Sun.

26, Find out how far Mandi is removed from the lord of the 8th house. When 

Saturn in the course of his transit arrives at the sign so far removed from Mandi, 

death may take place: So say the revered preceptors.

27. The death will definitely take place when the Sun in the course of his 

transit passes through the 6th, 7th or 12th house reckoned from Venus: this is the 

verdict of the preceptors.

28. The death may take place when Saturn, Jupiter Sun and the Moon in 

course of their transits pass through (1) the house occupied by the lord of the 8th, 

(2) the house occupied by the lord of the 12th, (3) the house occupied by the lord 

of the 6th, (4) the house occupied by the 8th house decanate i.e. the 22nd decanate 

and (5) the house occupied by Mandi.

The same may happen when these in the course of their transits pass through 

the navamsas of the five planets state above or their trikona positions.

Thus  ends  the  seventeenth  chapter  on  "Exit  from  the  World"  in  

Phaladeepika" composed by Mantreswara.

Chapter 18

Aspects of conjunction of two planets

1. If at the birth of a person the Sun be in conjunction with the Moon, he will 

be skilled in machine and stone work. If the Sun be in conjunction with Mars, he 

will be sinful. If the Sun be associated with Mercury, the native will be talented, 

intelligent,  renowned and happy.  If  the  Sun be in  conjunction with  Jupiter  the 

person concerned will be cruel and will intent on helping others. If the Sun and 

Venus be together at birth, the native will earn through dancing, singing, by acting 

in theatre or Cinema or by the use of weapons. If the Sun be in conjunction with 

Saturn; the native will be skillful in the working of metals or in various sorts of 

pottery.

2. If the Moon be in conjunction with Mars, the person will be a dealer in 

hammer,  ploughs  and  similar  rough  instruments,  and  earthen  pots.  He  will  be 

disobedient  to his mother.  If the Moon be associated with Mercury, the person 

concerned  will  be  soft  spoken,  will  be  clever  in  interpretation  (or  clever  in 

financial  matters).  He  will  be  fortunate  and  famous.  When  the  Moon  be  in 

conjunction with Jupiter, the person concerned will be victorious over enemies and 

fickle minded. He will be head of his family and very wealthy. If the Moon and 

Venus be together, the person concerned will specialise in weaving, tailoring and 

dying of clothes. If the Moon be in conjunction with Saturn, the person born will 

be the son of a woman (widow) who remarried.

3. If at birth Mars and Mercury be associated with each other, the person 

concerned, will be a dealer in herbs, plants, books, oil and drugs. He will be clever 

in boxing. If Mars and Jupiter be together he will be administrator of a city or 

town, or a king or a rich Brahmin. If Mars be with Venus, the person born will be 

owner of court, a wrestler, one who has affairs with other people's wives, gambler, 

and  clever.  When  Mars  and  Saturn  be  together  the  native  will  be  unhappy, 

condemned by all and does not stick to his word.

4.  When  Mercury  be  in  conjunction  with  Jupiter  at  birth,  the  person 

169



concerned will  be an actor,  fond of  singing and well  versed in dancing.  When 

Mercury be associated with Venus, the native will be eloquent in speech, owner of 

lands and will become head of assembly. If Mercury be conjoined with Saturn, the 

person will be an expert cheat, and addicted to licentious pleasures.

If Jupiter be in conjunction with Venus the person born will be learned, will 

possess wealth and wife and will be equipped with noble qualities. If Jupiter be 

associated with Saturn at birth, the person concerned will be a barber, a potter or a 

cook.

5. If Venus and Saturn be together, the native will be short sighted. Such a 

person earns wealth and becomes prosperous through a young woman. He will be 

well versed in painting and writing.

If more than two planets get Into conjunction in a house, the effects should 

be declared by taking into account the effects described for the various pairs of 

planets constituting the Yoga.

Effects of aspects on the Moon

become (1) possessor of limited progeny, (2) unhappy, (3) arrogant, (4) involved in 

his own work, (5) favourite of a wicked woman and (6) angry.

172



In the same manner should be predicted the effects resulting from the Sun in 

the several navamsas being aspected by the Moon and other planets.

16. What has been declared in verses 12-15 as effects of navamsa due to the 

Moon being  posited  in  the  navamsas  of  the  Sun and  other  planets,  should  be 

understood to be the effects derived from the navamsa division. The effects that 

have  been  mentioned  as  resulting  from  the  Moon  in  the  several  signs  being 

aspected by the different planets should be applicable in the case of Dwadasamsa 

also.

17.  The  good  effects  declared  above  will  be  full  or  medium  or  little 

according as the Moon occupies a Vargottama position, his own navamsa or the 

navamsa of another planet. In the case of bad effects it will be the reverse. Again, if 

the lord of navamsa occupied by the Moon be strong, the effects described for the 

Moon in several signs and aspected by the several planets will be multiplied and 

only their effects due to the Moon occupying the particular navamsa subject to the 

particular planetary aspect will come to pass.

Thus  ends  the  eighteenth  chapter  on  "Conjunction  of  two  Planets"  in  

Phaladeepika composed by Mantreswara.

Chapter 19

Dasas and their effects

1. The nine planets who were worshipped in many ways with devotion for a 

long  time  by  sage  Parasara,  having  been  pleased  bestowed  upon  him  the 

knowledge of accurately determining their effects (on births in this world). Being 

convinced after many tests that they are unfailing, I take out the essence from the 

astrological scripts containing his famous sayings and set forth the famous Maha 

Dasa.

2. Count the stars from Krittika in groups of nine. The planets presiding over 

the dasas belonging to the nine nakshatras composing each group are respectively 

the Sun, the Moon, Mars, Rahu, Jupiter, Saturn, Mercury, Ketu and Venus and the 

span of their dasa periods are respectively 6, 10, 7, 18, 16, 19, 17, 7 and 20 year.

Notes — The following table clarifies what has been mentioned above:—

Nakshatra Nakshatra Nakshatra Lord of Dasa period
Nakshatra 

Krittika U. Phalguni U. Ashada Sun 6 
Rohini Hasta Sravan Moon 10 
Mrigasira Chlttra Dhanista Mars 7 
Aridra Swati Satabhlsha Rahu 18 
Punarvasu Visakha P. Bhadra Jupiter 16 
Pushyami Anuradha U. Bhadra Saturn 19 
Ashlesha Jyestha Revti Mercury 17 
Magha Moola Aswini Ketu 7 
P. Phalguni P. Ashada Bhara Venus 10 

3.  Now is  described the method of  finding the  remainder of  the  dasa of 

planet at the time of birth. Find out the nakshatra in which the Moon is posited at 

birth  and  for  how  many  ghatikas  it  will  remain  after  birth  in  that  nakshatra. 

Multiply those ghatikas by the total period of the dasa and divide it by 60. The 

quotient will represent the period in years still to elapse. Any remainder remaining 

may be converted into months by multiplying by 30 and dividing by 60 and so on.

Notes — This is clarified below by an example. Suppose at the time of birth 

174



20 ghatikas were still to elapse in Punarvasu nakshatra. Birth in Punarvasu means 

that the dasa in operation would be of Jupiter. How much of Jupiter remains at the 

time of birth.

20*16/60 = 16/3 = 5 years 4 months.

There is some difference of opinion between the author of Phala deepika and 

other  authorities  about  the  method  of  above  calculation.  Accordingly  in  Shri 

Mantreshwara every result is to be divided by 60 but according to other authorities 

the division should be done by the whole measure.

(1) The generally recognised method

Add the ghatikas elapsed of the nakshatra and those still to elapse. Thus we 

get the total number of ghatikas of the nakshatra. Mark these ghatikas as 'A'.

Mark the ghatikas still to elapse as (B). Now suppose the birth has

taken place in the dasa of Jupiter, then the remainder of the dasa of Jupiter at 

birth will be calculated as under:

: If in A the dasa period is 16 years

: In 1 it will be — 16/A

: In B it will be — (16/A)*(B/1)

The result of this calculation will indicate the years, months, days etc., of the 

remainder of the dasa at birth.

(2) Method of calculation according to Shri Mantreshwar —

(16/A)*(B/1) years.

The difference is that in this method the total number of ghatikas are not 

taken into account. 'A' or the total numbner of ghatikas is always taken as 60. The 

remainder of the dasa only the basis of 'B'.

This in our view is not correct as the total number of ghatikas are not always 

60.

Now-a-days the easiest method of the remainder of the dasa accordingly is 

based  on  the  longitude  of  the  Moon  3-13°-12'  (Cancer  13°-12').  Cancer  is 

composed of one quater or 3°-20' of Punarvasu, four quarters of Ashlesha. As the 

longitude of 13°-12' in Cancer, it has passed the fourth quarter of Punarvasu in this 

175



sign  and  is  in  Pushyami  nakshatra.  To  find  out  how  much  it  has  moved  in 

Pushyami we will deduct 3°-20' of Punarvasu from the Moon's 13°-12'. Thus the 

balance will come to 9°-52'. The extent of the whole of Pushyami is 13°-20'. The 

lord of this nakshatra is Saturn whose total dasa period is 19 years. Therefore 13°-

20' being equal to 19 years, 9°-52' will be equal to 14 years 0 months of 22 days. 

This indicates that the 14 years and 22 days are observed over at birth and that 

would remain at credit at birth will be 19 years minus 14 years 22 days, that is, 4 

years 11 months and 8 days.

All these detailed calculations will be avoided if we obtain the balance of 

dasa at birth on the longitude by referring to ready made tables in Lahiri's annual 

Ephemeris.

4. Note the exact position of the Sun in the Zodiac at the time of birth when 

the Sun in his next round arrives at the same position, it is considered as a solar 

year, which is also the year taken for Udu adasa system (Vimsottari or naksharta 

dasa system). By subdividing the same, days are calculated.

5. If the Sun be badly placed at the time of birth, he in the course of his dasa 

causes quarrels and sudden wrath of the king, the ralatives will suffer from disease 

and the native will be wandering about. There will be intense anguish and danger 

from concealed wealth. The grain will be in danger of being burnt by fire and wife 

and sons (children) will be in distress.

6. Acquisition of wealth through cruel deeds, journeys and quarrels, roaming 

through mountains and maintaining, real, renown success in ventures, severity in 

temper and nature, devotion to duty and happiness, will be the effects during the 

Dasa of the Sun if he is well placed.

7. Peace of mind, success in all ventures, acquisition of wealth, good food, 

gains of wife,  sons,  clothes,  ornaments  cows,  agricultural  land and devotion to 

Brahmins will be the effects during the dasa of the Moon.

8. The effects of the dasa of the Moon described above will be derived in 

full if the Moon be endowed with full strength. From the first of Shukla Paksha 

upto the tenth tithi, the Moon is possessed of medium strength. During this period 

176



the effects will be medium. The ten days after, that is, from the 11th Tithi of the 

shukla paksha to  5th  Tithi  of  the  krishna  paksha the  Moon is  of  full  strength. 

Therefore, the good effects from such a Moon will be realised in full.

During the remaining ten days i.e. from the sixth tithi of krishna paksha up 

to Amavasya the Moon begins to wane and becomes weaker and weaker. Very little 

good effects will be derived from such a Moon.

9. Effects like acquisition of wealth through fire, fighting etc., gain of money 

by  administering  falsehood,  cheating  and  cruel  actions,  suffering  always  form 

bilious complaints, impurity of blood and fever, intrigues with low class women, 

quarreling with his wife, children, relatives and elders and misery caused by it, and 

enjoyment of fortune of others, will be experienced in the dasa of Mars.

10. Effects like meeting with friends, happiness,  admiration from learned 

persons,  acquisition  of  fame,  beneficience  by  preceptors,  eloquency  in  speech, 

helping others, happiness to wife, children, friends and relations are experienced in 

the dasa of Mercury.

11.  Effects  like  involvement  in  religious  affairs,  birth  of  children  or 

happiness in respect  of children,  honour from the king, praise by distinguished 

persons,  acquisition  of  elephants,  horses  and  other  conveyances,  fullfilment  of 

one's ambitions and cordial relations with wife, children and meeting freinds, will 

be experinced in the dasa of Jupiter.

12.  Effects  like  obtaining  of  materials  and  facilities  for  his  sport  and 

happiness,  acquisition  of  good  vehicles,  cows,  precious  stones,  ornaments,  a 

treasure,  enjoyment  in  association  with  young  women,  intellectual  pursuits. 

Journey by sea (or river), conferment of honours by the king and celebration of 

auspicious funcitions in the house, will be derived in the dasa of Venus.

13. Effects like his wife and children suffering from gout, rheumatism or 

similar  diseases,  loss  in  agriculture,  evil  talk,  intercourse  with  wicked women, 

desertion of servants, separation from wealth, will be realised by the native in the 

course of the dasa of Saturn.

14.  There  will  be  during  the  dasa  of  Rahu  danger  from the  king,  thief, 

177



poison,  fire  and weapons,  distress  to  children mental  tension,  loss  of  kinsmen, 

humiliation from low caste  people,  loss  of  reputation,  failure  and losses  in  all 

ventures and demotion in status.

15. Rahu's dasa will be full of auspicious effects if Rahu be associated with a 

benefic or be posited in an auspicious house. The native will enjoy the spendour 

like that of a king. He will achieve success in all his ventures and will live happily 

in his house. He will accumulate lasting wealth and his fame will spread far and 

wide on the Earth.

16. It is the view of those learned in Astrology that Rahu in Virgo, Pisces or 

Scorpio will  give the person concerned during his dasa,  honour and happiness, 

lordship of lands, conveyances and servants. All these will, however, be liable to 

be lost at the conclusion of the dasa.

17.  Effects  like danger from enemies,  thieves,  wrath of  the king,  fear of 

injury from weapon, diseases caused by heat, a stigma to family of the native, fear 

from fire, deportation from the native place as a result of some serious accusation.

Notes — In verses 5 to 17 the effects of the dasa of the Sun, the Moon, 

Mars, Mercury, Jupiter, Venus and Saturn in their usual order have been described 

in a general way.

Now in verses 18 to 26 the effects of the dasa of all the planets have been 

described again  but  they  are  in  the  order  prescribed under  the  Vimsottari  dasa 

system.

It appears that the effects given in verses 5-17 are such as could be ascribed 

to the other dasa systems also.

There are some peculiarities in the Vimsottari dasa syatem, as the effects of 

the dasas of planets will be governed by the rules laid down by Parasara. Under 

these rules the lord of the 11th house (the house of gains) has been termed as papi. 

Not only that the lord of the 3rd and 6th also have been allotted that same title. The 

lord of the 3rd is the least papi and the lord of the 11th the biggest papi. Another 

rule is that if a benefic be the lord of a kendra, he does not produce benefic effects, 

and if the lord of a kendra be malefic, he does not produce inauspicious effects.

178



Therefore the effects given in verses 5-17 should not apply to Vimsottari 

dasa system.

18.  General  effects  like  acquisition  of  wealth  through  cruel  actions  or 

through kings or through fighting, buring in eyes, abdominal and dental disorders, 

serious trouble to wife and children, loses of servants, and wealth, separation from 

reverred elders and parents, will be dertvded during the dasa of the Sun.

Notes — In our view these effects will  be experienced if  the Sun is  not 

auspiciously disposed in any nativity. The Sun will definitely produce very good 

results, if he is well phased. For example, in an Aries Langna nativity Sun as the 

lord of the 5th or in Sagittarius Lagna chart Sun as lord of the 9th in the 9th or 10th 

will raise the native to dizzy heights.

19. The general effects that will be experienced during the dasa of the Moon 

will be gain of wealth through the mantras (hymns) and the beneficance of deities, 

Brahmins and the king, acquisition of wife, wealth, and agricultural land, gain of 

flowers, clothes, ornaments, and objects of enjoyment of various tastes. There will 

be animosity with wicked people, loss of wealth and suffering from Rheumatism.

Notes — In this verse both auspicious and inauspicious effects have been 

described of the dasa of the Moon. The good effects should be retained if the Moon 

be endowed with strength, be auspiciously posited and be lord of a favourable 

house. The adverse effects will be felt if the Moon be weak or be unfavourably 

disposed.

20. During the dasa of the Mars there will  be,  on the part  of the native, 

efforts  to  earn  money  through  lands,  litigation  and  the  king.  He  will  acquire 

agricultural lands and cattle. There will be enmity with his son and brothers and he 

will  be attached to women of ill  fame. He will  suffer  from impurity of  blood, 

diseases arising from heat and loss through fire. There will also be loss of wealth.

21. General effects like becoming wicked in disposition, suffering from a 

dangerous disease, destruction of wife and children of the native, fear or danger 

from poison,  distress  or  trouble  from enemies,  diseases  of  the  eye  and  heart, 

animosity with friends and servants working on agricultural land and animosity 

179



with the king, will be experienced when the dasa of Rahu be in operation.

Notes - Rahu and Ketu are shadowy planets. They are said to give effects 

according to the houses they occupy according to the planets they are associated 

with According to Laghu Parasari.

That is, if Rahu or Ketu be posited in kendra or trikona and be connected 

with the lord of kendra or Trikona, they cause yoga which means they become 

yogakarakas. Rahu or ketu will definitely produce immensely good results when 

his dasa be in operation. Lagna Parasari goes to the extent of Saying.

This means that if Rahu arid ketu are well placed (i.e. in the langa, the 5th or 

9th)  give  the  effects  of  a  yogakaraka  planet  in  the  an  tar  dasa  of  yogakaraka 

Irrespective of the fact whether they are connected or not with a yogakarka planet.

See also in this connection what has been said about the effects of Rahu if he 

is well disposed in verse 15th of this Chapter.

22. Acquisition of new clothes, and such other objects, servants, retinue and 

similar grandeur, commanding great respect and dignity, birth of children, gain of 

wealth and friends, receipts of admiration for the eloquence of his speech, will be 

the good effects when the dasa of Jupiter be in operation. The evil effects of dasa 

will be separation from elders, ear disease and phelgmatic troubles.

23. The general effects during the dasa of Saturn will be acquistion of wealth 

consequent of the war or disturbances of the country, acquisition of servants and 

old women, cattle like buffaloes, and bulls, trouble to wife and children, suffering 

from windy diseases like  rheumatism, gout  etc.,  phlegmatic diseases,  piles  and 

burning in hand and feet.

24. During the dasa of Mercury the native will get the benefit of learning 

from preceptors or will himself become a very learned and influential preceptor. 

There  will  be  gain  of  agricultural  lands,  cows  and  horses  and  money  from 

Brahmins. He will get into association with persons of high status. He will worship 

gods and acquire immense wealth. He will suffer from wind, heat and phlegm.

25. During the dasa of Ketu the native will suffer from sorrow and confusion 

caused by females, trouble from the rich and loss of wealth. He will do injustice to 

180



others. He will be banished from his country (native place). He will suffer from 

dental trouble, pain in the legs and phlegmatic troubles.

Notes - Please see our comments under verse 21 about the effects of the dasa 

of Rahu.

26. Acquisition of wife, jewels, cloths, lustrous gems, concealed treasure, 

wealth,  ornaments,  horses,  conch,  etc.,  gain  of  money  from trade,  agricultrual 

pursutis, export and import of goods, separation from elders (like parents), loss of 

peace of mind and distress to kinsmen,  will  be the general  effects experienced 

during the dasa of Venus.

Thus  ends  the  19th  Adhyaya  on  "Dasas  and  their  Effects"  in  the  work  

Phaladeepika composed by Mantreswara.

happy associations and relationship with kinsmen, becoming minister of a king, 

conferment of honours, involvement in virtuous actions and praise for it from the 

people and enjoyment of many kinds of delicious preparations shared with others, 

will be derived during the dasa of the lord of the 5th house.

7. If the 6th be very strongly disposed, effects like overcoming the enemies 

182



by his valour, remaining free from diseases, being generous and powerful, enjoying 

his wealth, splendour and prosperity will be realised by the native during the dasa 

of the lord of the 6fh house.

8. If the 7th house be endowed with full strength, during the dasa of the lord 

of the 7th, the native will acquire new clothes and ornaments and will live happily 

with  his  wife.  His  virility  or  physical  strength  will  Increase  and  auspicious 

functions  like  marriage  etc.,  will  be  celebrated  in  his  house.  He  will  perform

of many servants. There will be domestic happiness and great prosperity.

13.  During  the  dasa  of  the  lord  of  the  12th,  the  native  will  spend 

extravagantly on good causes. He will perform meritorious acts and thus be free 

from  the  evil  effects  of  the  sins  committed.  He  will  also  be  conferred  royal 

honours.

14. The good effects described above in verses 2 to 13 are derived only 

when the lord of the house concerned is auspiciously disposed (not placed in the 

6th,  8th,  or  12th),  is  posited in his  own sign or  in his  sign of  exaltation  or  is 

183



retrograde. The effects will be adverse if such a planet is inauspiciously disposed, 

is in his inimical sign, in his sign of debilitation or is eclipsed by the Sun's rays. 

Now described below are the effects of the planet (lord of a house), who is not well 

disposed.

15.  When  the  lord  of  the  Lagna  is  badly  placed,  the  native  will  be 

imprisoned  during  his  dasa.  He  will  lead  his  life  in  cognito,  will  suffer  fear, 

diseases and mental  anguish,  will  participate  in funeral  rites,  will  incur loss of

family, write objectionable letters, will suffer from eye troubles, will have a harsh 

tongue, incur lot of expenditure and will face displeasure of the king.

16. If the lord of the 3rd house be weak, there will be loss of brothers and

be humiliated and lose his pride.

If the lord of the 4th house be weak, during his dasa the mother of the native, 

his kinsmen and his friends will be distressed. There will be danger of destruction 

of his house, agricultural lands and cattle and also danger from water.

17. If the lord of the 5th lacks strength and is badly placed, during his dasa, 

the native will lose a son. He will suffer from aberration of mind, will be a victim 

of deception and will wander here and there aimlessly. He will suffer from stomach 

disorders, face wrath or displeasure of king and will feel physicially weak.

During the dasa of the lord of the 6th house who is deficient in strength, 

there will be danger from thieves. He will face poverty, will be overpowered by 

others and will suffer from diseases, will receive shabby treatment or indulge in 

undesirable  actions.  He  will  serve  others  and  suffer  humiliation  and  loss  of 

reputation. He will have injuries in his body.

18. If the lord of the 7th be weak, during his dasa, the son-in-law of the 

native  will  be  in  distress.  The  native  will  make  separation  from his  wife  and 

184



something untoward will happen through the opposite sex and he will have affairs 

with wicked women and will suffer from venereal diseases. He will be wandering 

aimlessly.

When the dasa  of  a  badly  placed and weak lord of  the  8th  house  be in 

operation, the person concerned will suffer from great sorrow, loss of intelligence, 

intense sexual  desire,  jealousy,  fainting fits,  poverty,  fruitless  rambling,  loss  of 

reputation, sickness and humiliation. Even his life may end during the dasa of such 

a planet.

19. During the dasa of the lord of 9th house who is weak, the wife and 

children of the native will be in trouble. He will suffer in many ways due to wrath 

of deity that had been worshipped formerly. He will indulge in undesirable actions 

and one of his elder brothers and his father may die and he himself may suffer 

from penury.

When the lord of the 10th house be devoid of strength, during his dasa, the 

native  will  face  failure  in  all  his  undertakings  and  he  will  indulge  in  wicked 

actions, he may have to live away from his homeland and may suffer distress on 

that  account.  He will  have to face untoward happenings and will  incur loss of 

honour.

20. If the lord of the 11th be adversely disposed and be weak, the brother 

(elder) of the native will be in trouble. His son will be sickly, he (the native) will 

suffer from misery, deception and ear diseases.

During the dasa of a weak lord of the 12th house, the native will suffer from 

many  diseases,  dishonour  and  slavery.  All  his  wealth  will  disappear  like  the 

(waning) Moon in the dark half of the month.

21. Whatever has been stated in the Chapter 1, whatever has been mentioned 

as belonging to  the  presiding  planets  (Chapter  2),  whatever  calling is  declared 

appropriate  in  chapter  on  profession  (Chapter  5),  whatever  diseases  have  been 

described as due to the several planets (Chapter 14), whatever has been said as the 

effects of the aspect or association with the planets (Chapter 18), or of the presence 

of  planets  in  houses  or  of  the  lords  of  the  several  houses  or  the  lord  being 

185



associated with others (Chapter 15, 16, 17), all this must be duly assigned to the 

planets concerned in their respective dasas.

22. If a planet occupies Vargottamamsa he produces very favourable effects 

in his dasa. Mixed effects are derived in the dasa of a planet who being Vargottama 

is in his sign of deblitation or is eclipsed by the Sun's rays. Adverse results may be 

when the dasa of any of the lord of the 6th, 8th or 12th house in the an tar dasa of 

any of them be in operation. Similar will be the effect of the dasa of the planet 

posited in the 6th, 8th, or 12th and an tar dasa of any one of them.

23. There will be theft in the house of the native, he will be troubled by 

enemies and he will suffer great misery, during the dasa of a cruel planet (malefic) 

and the an tar dasa of any of the lords of the 3rd, 5th or 7th nakshatra reckoned 

from the Janma nakshatra (natal star). The same will be the results in the dasa of a 

malefic and in the antar dasa of the lord of the Moon sign or of the 8th house there 

from.

24. The following dasas will bring misery and trouble :-

(1) The dasa of Saturn if it is the fourth in the order of main dasas.

(2) The dasa of Jupiter if it is the sixth

(3) The dasa of the Mars and Rahu if they are fifth.

(4) The dasa of a planet who is placed in the last degree of a sign.

(5) The dasas of the lords of the 6th, 8th and 12th houses.

Notes — If any body is born in the dasa of Mars, Saturn's dasa will be the 

fourth for him. For one born in the dasa of Venus, Rahu dasa will be fifth and 

Jupiter's dasa the sixth for him. For one born in the dasa of Ketu, Mars dasa will be 

the fifth for him.

25. If Mars in an Urdhvamukha sign or in his sign of exaltation be posited in 

the 10th or 11th house,  the native will  acquire a kingdom in his dasa.  He will 

become  a  king  and  cause  destruction  of  his  enemies  and  will  possess  many 

vehicles and a huge army and

26. If Venus be in his sign of exaltation or in his own sign and be posited in 

the  10th,  11th  or  the  12th  house,  uneclipsed  and free  from the  influence  of  a 

186



malefic, the native during his dasa, will become very wealthy, will be full of glory 

and splendour and will  be endowed with gold and precious stones etc.,  will  be 

widely praised and enjoy all comforts.

27. All benefics if placed in their sign of debilitation, inimical signs or the 

6th or 12th house, they will produce only adverse results while malefic similarly 

placed will cause miseries during their dasa periods.

28. The native will face danger from enemies, suffer loss or position and 

earn hostility oi persons who had been his friends, during the dasa of a planet and 

the an tar dasa of the planet (1) who is inimical to the lord of the dasa, (2) who is in 

an inimical sign, (3) one who is posited in the 6th or (4) who is inimical to lord of 

the lagna.

29. Which ever house counted from the lord of the dasa is occupied by the 

lord of antar dasa, it is the effects arising from that house during the antar dasa is 

posited in 6th, 8th or 12th with reference to the lord of the dasa. In other positions 

the effects will be good.

30.  If  a  benefic  or  a  lord  of  a  benefic  house  is  posited  in  his  sign  of 

exaltation, he produces maximum good effects. The effects will be three-fourth if 

such a planet be in his Moolatrikona sign. It will be half if he be in his own sign. It 

will be one-fourth in a friend's sign, very little in his inimical sign and almost nil 

when it is in his sign of debilitation. In the case of malefics or lords of malefic 

houses the results will be reversed. When a planet is in combustion its effect will 

be similar to that in his sign of debilitation.

31. Find out which amongst the following is the weakest — (a) Saturn, (b) 

Mandi, (c) Rahu, (d) the lord of the 22nd decanate from the lagna, (e) lord of the 

8th, (f) lords of the navamsa signs occupied by them. It is the dasa of the weakest 

amongst  them that  proves  fatal  for  the  native  and the  death  takes  place  when 

Saturn in the course of his transit passes through an untoward house (6th, 8th or 

12th).

32. See who amongst the following pairs of planets is stronger-la) the lord of 

the house occupied by the lord of the 8th house and lord of the navamsa sign 

187



occupied by the lord of the 8th house. And the lord of the 22nd decamate from the 

lagna and the lord of decanate of the lagna. The death of the native takes place 

when Jupiter in the course of his transit passes through any of the following places 

—

(1) the sign occupied by the lord of the 8th house, (2) the navamsa occupied 

by the lord of the 8th house, (3) in trlkona position to (1) and (2).

33. If Jupiter, the lord of the house occupied by the Moon and the lord of the 

lagna be posited in kendra at birth, the middle portion of the life will be happy. 

Planets in shirshodaya, ubhayodaya and prishtodaya signs give their results in the 

beginning, in the middle and in the end respectively.

34. If the lord of the dasa be endowed with strength at the time of birth 

passes in the course of his transit through his sign of exaltation, his own sign or a 

friend's sign, promotes the growth of the house reckoned from the lagna.

Notes — Suppose Rahu is endowed with full strength in a nativity, his dasa 

is in progress when in the course of his transit he will pass through the 11th house 

counted  from the  lagna  the  native  will  have  gains  of  wealth.  When he  passes 

through the 10th in transit, the native will get promotion in his position. When it 

will pass through the 9th the native will have dawn of fortune.

35. When a planet who's dasa is in progress be weak at birth, be eclipsed by 

the Sun's rays, be in his sign of debilitation or be in a inimical sign, he will during 

the course of transit through any house, cause its total destruction.

Notes — Suppose the lagna is Virgo and Saturn is posited in the 8th house in 

his sign of debilitation. During the dasa of Saturn, if in the course of his transit he 

passes  through the  sign  Leo which  is  an  inimical  sign identical  with  the  12th 

house, the 12th house will produce very evil effects during that period.

36.  The  effects  will  be  good  and auspicious,  when  in  the  course  of  his 

transit, the Moon passes through (1) the exaltation house of the lord of the dasa, (2) 

the houses friendly to the lord of the dasa and (3) the 3rd, 5th, 6th, 7th, 9th, 10th 

and 11th houses reckoned from the lord of the dasa.

Notes  —  If  any  person  wants,  to  know  whether  the  Moon  will  give 

188



auspicious effects on a particular day, he should expect good effects if the Moon is 

in any one of the positions mentioned above with the lord of the dasa in progress.

37. If a planet whose antar dasa is in operation should on the course of his 

transit  at  the  time  pass  through  his  sign  of  debilitation,  an  inimical  house  or 

become eclipsed,  there will  be much misery.  Should he pass through his  own, 

exaltation house or be retrograde, the effects will then be good.

38.  If  the  antar  dasa  of  a  planet  is  favourable,  the  good effects  will  be 

experienced when the Sun, in the course of his transit, passes through his sign of 

exaltation. Similar effects will be derived when Jupiter in the course of his transit 

passes through that sign of exaltation. As regards the planet whose antar dasa is 

likely to yield inauspicious or adverse effects, such evil  effects will  be realised 

when the Sun in the course of his transit passes through the antar dasa lord's sign of 

debilitation or inimical sign.

39.  Rahu will  affect  the  planet  with  whom he is  associated.  That  planet 

through good and auspicious by himself will produce evil effects particularly at the 

end of his dasa.

Notes — In the example horoscope, Rahu is associated with Venus who is 

posited in  his  own sign.  Rahu will  take over  the  nature  and auspiciousness  of 

Venus and produce effects in dasa or antar dasa according to them. Venus on the 

other hand will become afflicted and produce evil effects during his dasa or antar 

dasa particlarly at their end.

40. The 2nd and 7th houses are maraka (death producing) houses.  If  the 

lords  of  these houses or  planets posited therein,  are powerful  they cause death 

duing their dasa. If the lord of the 8th or 12th house be very weak, death is likely to 

take place in the an tar dasa of any of the two.

41.  The  dasa  of  a  planet  who is  lord  of  a  kendra  will  be  adverse  if  he 

happens to be a benefic natural  benefic and auspicious or favourable if he is a 

(natural)  malefic.  The  dasa  of  all  the  planets  who  are  trikonas  (1,5,9)  will  be 

favourable. The lords of the 3rd, 6th and 11th houses, even if benefics, they will 

always produce evil effects during their dasas. The lord of the 8th house, if he also 

is the lord of the lagna will be auspicious and will produce good effects in his dasa. 

The Sun and the Moon even if they own the 8th house give only good effects. 

(They do not suffer from the stigma of being lords of the 8th house.) These are the 

effects of several dasas according to Parasara's opinion.

42. If (1) the lord of a trikona be in a kendra, (2) the lord of a kendra be in a 

trikona, they will both prove auspicious. If the dasa of one and the an tar dasa of 

the ohter be in operation, the effects will be very favourable. They will help each 

other, cooperate to make the period auspicious.

43. No planet produces good or bad effects to the native in accordance with 

the house he owns during his dasa and his own antar dasa.

44.  Find  out  what  all  planets  are  related  (Chapter  25,  verse  30)  to  the 

particular planet whose dasa is under consideration. Note also the planets if any 

which are similarly circumstanced (whether for good or bad) i.e. holding a position 

coordinate to the one under reference. It is only in the antar dasas of these planets 

that the original planet will in his main dasa manifest his effect.

45. The lords of kendras and trikonas, even if they themselves be capable of 

causing evil (owning to their having lordships of evil house), become yogakarakas 

by their mere relationship and make the native prosperous.

Notes — For example for the Aries Ascendant both Saturn lord of the 10th a 

kendra and also of 11th (for which he beccmes a papi) and Jupiter is lord of the 9th 

a trikona and the 6th a dusthana. But they get related with each other (vide Chapter 

15, verse 30) they become yogakarakas and thus auspicious in the nature.

46. If out of the lords of the 5th and 9th any one of them gets related to a 

strong planet owning a kendra, he becomes a yogakaraka, (capable of promoting 

the property of the native).

47. If the lord of a kendra be associated with any of the lords of the 5th or 

the 9th, they both become yogakarakas.

If the lord of a kendra while being related to lord of one trikona, be also 

related to the lord of the other trikona, a most powerful Raja Yoga will  be the 

result.

Notes — Here it will be relevant to point out that if the same planet owns a 

kendra and a trikona, he becomes a yogakaraka for that ascendant. For the Taurus 

Ascendant Saturn is lord of 9th and 10th. Therefore he will be a yogakaraka. For 

the Cancer and Leo Ascendants Mars owns the 5th and the 10th and the 4th and 9th 

respectively.  Thus  Mars  is  a  yogakaraka  for  these  Ascendants.  Saturn  is  a 

Yogakaraka for the Libra ascendant being the lord of the 4th and the 5th. Venus is 

yogakaraka for the Capricorn and Aquarius ascendants being lords of the 5th and 

the 10th and the 4th and the 9th respectively.

48. Though the planets may be themselves (natural malefics) but If they are 

related  to  a  yogakaraka  (planet  producing  prosperity)  good  effects  will  be 

191



experienced by the native during their antar dasas leading him to affluence and 

happiness.

49. The lord of a trikoria house will during his dasa and the antar dasa of the 

lord of a kendra will produce good effects. Even if the two planets may not be 

connected the dasa of one and the antar dasa of the other will be productive of 

good effects.

50-51. If Jupiter and Venus be lords of kendras, they become powerful to 

cause  evil  effects.  Should  they  occupy  the  maraka  houses  (2nd  and 7th),  they 

become powerful marakas (inflicters of death).

Mercury in this respect is less powerful. The Moon comes next to Mercury.

Malefics when they be lords of kendras, become more and more auspicious 

in their effects.

52. If Rahu and Ketu occupy a kendra or trikona they become yogakarakas if 

they get connected with the lord of kendra or trikona.

If  Rahu  or  Ketu  should  occupy  the  sign  of  a  benefic  which  is  not  an 

inauspicious  house  and are  not  connected  with  any  planet,  they  produce  good 

effects in their antar dasas.

If Rahu and Ketu are not connected with any planet and are posited in an 

auspicious house (kendra or trikona), they will produce good effects during their 

dasa and the antar dasa of a yogakaraka.

54. During the dasa of a yogakaraka planet, the Raja Yoga begins when the 

antar dasa of karaka planets are in progress. The antar dasas of malefics which 

succeed them in their turn increase the same.

Notes — Another version of this verse as given by Pt. Gopesh Kumar Ojha 

in his Hindi translation of Phaladeepika is as under :—

This means that if Raja yoga begins with the antar dasa of a maraka planet, 

the native gets yogakaraka effects in name only. The real prosperity and glorious 

effects of Raja yoga evade him.

55. The following planets cause great misery to the native —

(1) The planet posited in the 8th house.

192



(2) The planet who aspects the 6th house.

(3) The lord of the 8th house.

(4) The planet owning the decanate of the 8th house.

(5) The planet owning the sign occupied by Mandi.

From amongst the weakest will be capable of causing death of the native 

during his dasa or antar dasa.

56.  The  dasa  of  a  planet  fallen  from exaltation  is  termed  Avarohini  or 

descending,  while  that  of  a  planet  in  a  friend's  house  is  named  Madhya  or 

middling. The dasa of a planet proceeding from his debilitation is called Arohini or 

ascending.  The  dasa  of  a  planet  that  is  actually  in  his  depression  or  inimical 

navamsa is termed, Adhama or worst

Notes — It has already been mentioned earlier at which degree of a sign a 

planet is in deep exaltation and what degree of a particular sign the planet is in 

debilitation. For example the Sun is in deep exaltation at 10 degrees of Aries and 

he  is  in  deep  debilitation  at  10  degrees  of  Libra.  During  the  interval  the  Sun 

proceeds from 10 degrees of Libra trowards to 10 degrees of Aries and until he 

reaches there, he will be called Arohi or ascending. But the interval, the Sun after 

reaching 10 degrees Aries proceeds 10 degrees of Libra and until he reaches there, 

he will be termed as Avarohi or descending. The effects of the dasa of an avarohi 

planet are bad, while the effects of an Arohi planet are good. But even if a planet 

be Avarohi his dasa will be ordinarily favourable if he is posited in his exalted or 

friend's Navamsa, while even if a planet be arohi. If he be posited in his sign of 

depression, in an inimical sign, in debilitated navamsa or in an Inimical navamsa, 

his dasa will be Adhama or adverse.

57. Even if a planet be in his sign of debilitation or in his Inimical sign or be 

eclipsed by the Sun's rays, his dasa will produce mixed effects, if he occupies an 

auspicious house or Navamsa and will be capable of giving good effects in the 

latter half of the dasa.

58. Death of the relative signified by a particular house will take place In the 

main dasa of the planet in the house 12th to that house or of the planet owning it, 

193



whoever is weaker.

59. If the lord of the dasa in the course of his transit  passes through the 

lagna, the 3rd, the 6th, the 10th or 11th house reckoned from him or If the lord of 

the dasa comes to the sapta varga places of the lagna, or when a friendly planet or a 

benefic planet comes to the lagna, the Dasa will prove auspicious at that time i.e. 

during the periods of transits mentioned above.

60. Note which planet's dasa or antar dasa is in progress and where he is 

situated in the course of his transit with reference to the natal Moon. The dasa or 

antar dasa will produce good effects during the periods of the lords of the dasa or 

in the course of his transit comes to auspicious places with reference to the natal 

Moon and Dasa effects will be adverse if the lord of dasa comes to inauspicious 

houses from the position of natal Moon.

61. The Moon produces beneficial effects when in the course of her transit, 

she passes through (1) the friend's house of the lord of the Dasa (2) the sign in 

which the lord of the dasa is exalted and (3) houses 3, 5, 6, 7, 9, 10 and 11 from the 

lord of the dasa.

62. In the favourable positions mentioned in the previous verse,  the sign 

occupied by the Moon should represent some one of the 12 house, lagna, wealth 

etc.,  at  the  time  of  birth.  The  one  of  these  favourable  positions  promotes  the 

prosperity  in  respect  of  the  house  represented  by  the  sign  occupied.  In  the 

unfavourable positions, the house represented by the sign occupied by the Moon 

suffers damage.

63. While assessing the various effects in a nativity it is admirable to study 

the  principles  laid  down  in  Saravali  (by  Kalyana  Varma),  Hora  Shastra  by 

Varahamihira and the Nakshatra Dasa. While making such an assessment, careful 

note should be taken of the planets with reference to the lagna at the time of query 

or janma rasi (Moon sign) or Lagna at birth. There will not be much difference 

between  the  Prasna  Lagna  and  the  Janma  Lagna  in  the  matter  of  making 

predictions.

Notes — Sloka 32. — It may be interesting to note why Jupiter has been 

194



particularly mentioned for causing the death of the person when he transits through 

the  Rasi  and  the  Navamsa  occupied  by  the  Lord  of  the  eighth  house  or  its 

triangular  position.  The reader  will  note  that  Jupiter  is  the  only  planet  who is 

exalted in the eighth house from his own sign. It only shows the magnanimity of 

the planet who is defined to exhibit his full lustre even when he is posited in a bad 

house as the 8th house. This is because he is a Philosopher.

Sloka 41. — The Sun and the Moon are declared to be auspicious even when 

they own the 8th house. i.e. for the people born in Makara and Dhanus they are 

respectively auspicious. This is because the Sun becomes the creater for person 

born in Makara, while the Moon becomes the owner of the house in which lord of 

Dhauns (Jupiter) is exalted. It is therefore relevant that both these planets should 

prove auspicous to persons torn In Makara Lagna and Dhanus Lagna respectively.

Sloka 54. — The lord of a Kendra and Kona is termed the Yogakaraka.

Thus  ends  the  twentieth  chapter  on  "Dasas  of  Bhava  Lords  and  their  

Bhukties" in Phaladeepika composed by Mantreswara.

Chapter 21

Divisions of a sign

1. In this chapter is explained the method of calculating the antar dasa and 

pratyantar  dasa.  There  are  antar  dasas  of  all  the  nine  planets  in  a  dasa.  For 

example, in the dasa of the Sun there will be the antar dasas of the Sun and all the 

other planets. The first antar dasa is of the same planet who is the lord of the dasa. 

For example, in the dasa of Jupiter the order of antar dasas will be Jupiter, Saturn, 

Mercury, Ketu, Venus, the Sun, the Moon, Mars and Rahu. In the dasa of Venus the 

order of antar dasa will be venus, the Sun, the Moon, Mars, Rahu, Jupiter, Saturn, 

Mercury and Ketu.

As there are nine antar dasas in a dasa, there are nine pratyantar dasas in an 

antar dasa. The first pratyantar dasa will be of the lord of antar dasa.

Whatever has been here described as effects of any planet, all this should 

occur in the planet's dasa, in his antar dasa and in his pratyantar dasa.

2. The period of antar dasa in a dasa should be calculated by the rule of 

three. Suppose if we have to know the duration of antar dasa of the Sun in the dasa 

of Venus we should proceed as explained below. In 120 years the Sun's portion is 

of 6years. In 1 year the Sun's portion will be (6/120)*1. Therefore, in 20 years the 

Sun will have Antar Dasa of (6*1/120)*20 = 1 year.

The Sun's dasa is of 6 years and the dasa of Venus is of 20 years. Therefore 

the figures of 20 and 6 have been taken above. The pratyantar dasa in any case can 

also be calculated in the same manner. We have found out that in the dasa of Venus 

the duration of Sun's an tar dasa is 1 year. Now let us find out how much will be 

the duration of pratyantar dasa of the Sun in his antar dasas.

In 120 years the duration is 6 years

In 1 year it will be (6*1/120) = 1/20 years

(1/20)*360 days = 18 days.

Thus in the dasa of Venus, the duration of the pratyantar dasa of the Sun in 

his antar dasa will be 18 days.

196



These  informations  are  available  in  readymade  tables  in  the  various 

Panchangas which can be usefully utilised.

Notes  —  Shri  V.  Subrahmaniam  Sastry  has  explained  the  method  of 

calculation as under :—

"Multiply the years of maha dasa by the years of the planet whose antar dasa 

is required. Divide the period by 120. The quotient will represent the years of antar 

dasa. Multiply the remainder by 12 and divide the result by 120. The quotient will 

represent  the  months,  multiply  the  remainder  by  30  and  divide  by  120.  The 

quotient will give the days and so on. The same process should be adopted for 

calculating the sub-divisions. In any dasa the order of the antar dasa is similar to 

that in the dasa of the first antar dasa commencing with that of its lord."

There  is  an  easy  method  by  mean  of  which  the  antar  dasa  can  be 

independently calculated. This may be helpful at times when the antar dasa tables 

are not readily available.

Multiply the number of years of dasa period of the planet by the number of 

years of dasa of the period of the planet antar dasa is required. The last figure in 

the product always represents the decimal of a month and the rest represents the 

total number of months. Then cutting of the last digit of the product, multiuply it 

by 3 and keep that figure as days. Suppose we want to find out the antar dasa of 

Mercury in the dasa of Saturn. Multiply the dasa period of Mercury 17 years by 

that of Saturn viz. 19 years i.e. 19*17 = 323. By adopting the above method the 

antar dasa of Mercury will be 32 months and 9 days i.e. 2 years 8 months 9 days.

Effects of antar dasas in the dasa of the Sun.

3. During the antar dasa of the Sun in his dasa. the person born will achieve 

renown by the beneficience of the king. He will acquire wealth and wander about 

in mountain and forest regions and will suffer from fever and heat troubles. He 

may lose his father. Notes — The good effects may be expected when the Sun be 

well placed and the evil effects will occur when the Sun is adversely posited.

4. Effects like destruction of enemies, relief from distress, influx of wealth, 

acquisition of agricultural lands, building a house and meeting with friends are the 

197



likely effects to be experienced by the native in the antar dasa of the Moon in the

dasa of the Moon.

Notes - In our view for the Cancer and Leo Ascendant for which Mars is

acquisition of wealth, growth of prosperity and earning name and fame, if Mars be 

well disposed in the nativity.

14. Occuring of a severe reproach or fault, increase of enemies, illness of 

kinsmen danger from thunder storms, lightning and illness caused by food, drink or

Chapter 22

Kalachakra dasa

1.  (A)  Three  nakshatras  from Aswini,  viz.  Aswini,  Bharani  and  Krittika 

comprise of 12 quarters. Aries, Taurus, Gemini and Cancer are the four navamsa of 

Aswini.  Leo,  Virgo,  Libra  and  Scorpio  will  be  the  four  navamsa  of  Bharani. 

Sagittarius Capricorn, Aquarius and Pisces will be the four navamsas of Krittika. In 

this order (Apasavya or Apradakhina order) divide the three nakshatras by the 12 

navamsas.

(B) There will be 12 navamsa of three nakshatras from Rohini viz., Rohlni, 

Mrigasira and Aridra counting them in reverse order from Scorpio i.e.  Scorpio, 

Libra, Virgo, Leo, Cancer, Gemini, Taurus, Aries, Pisces, Aquarius, Capricorn and 

Sagittarius, divide them by the 12 navamsas. Scorpio will be the navamsa of the 

first quarter of Rohini, Libra will be the navamsa of 2nd quarter of Rohini and so 

on ultimately finding that in this order Sagittarius will be the navamsa of the fourth 

quarter of Aridra. (This is known as Savya—reverse, Apradakhina or anticlockwise 

order).

2. These are the trends of nakshatras reckoned in their order (from Aswini) 

to  be  distinguished  as  Apasavya  and  Savya.  The  years  assigned  to  a  planet 

constitute the dasa period of the sign owned by that planet. This is the peculiarity 

in the' Kalachakra system, say the wise.

3.  The Sun's  dasa period is  5 years  (Leo is  the sign owned by the Sun, 

therefore dasa period of Leo will be 5 years). The dasa period of the Moon is 21 

years (the dasa of Cancer owned by the Moon will be the same). The dasa of Mars 

will be of 7 years (the dasa of Aries and Scorpio will be the same). The dasa of 

Mercury will be 9 years (the dasa period of Gemini and Virgo owned by Mercury 

will be the same). The dasa of Jupiter will be 10 years (the dasa of Sagittarius and 

Pisces owned by Jupiter will be the same). The dasa of Venus will be of 16 years 

(the dasa period of Taurus and Libra owned by Venus will be the same). The dasa 

of Saturn will be of 4 years (the dasa period of Capricorn and Aquarius owned by 

209



Saturn will be the same). The effects of kalachakra dasa are to be declared on the 

basis of the sign whose dasa be in progress and its lord.

4. In this kalachakra system consisting of dasas. An tar dasas, etc., I shall 

now expound the formula for the several nakshatra padas from Aswini onwards. 

Every such formula consists of nine syllables indicating by their number (as per 

katapayadi  memories)  the  particular  rasyapaharas  composing  the  dasa  of  the 

nakshatra  pada  under  consideration  and  consequently  by  total  life  period 

appertaining thereto by means of the years allotted to the several owners of the 

signs.

7.  The  formula  for  Aswini  and  Bharani  are  described  above.  The  four 

formulas given for the four padas of Aswini will also respectively apply to the four 

padas  of  Krittika  in  the  Apasavya  pradakshina  triad.  Formulas  for  Rohini  and 

Mrigasira in the Savya triad are stafed in the next two verses and the four formulas 

given for the four padas of Mrigasira should also be used again for the four padas 

of Aridra.

Saturn (6) Aquarius-Saturn (7) Pisces-Jupiter (8) Aries-Mars and (9) Taurus-Venus.

For the 3rd pada of Mrigasira the 9 dasas will be in the following order— 

(1) Gemini-Mercury (2) Leo-Sun (3) Cancer-Moon (4) Virgo-Mercury (5) Libra-

Venus  (6)  Scorpio-Mars  (7)  Pisces-Jupiter  (8)  Aquarius-Saturn  (9)  Capricorn-

Leo-Sun (6) Cancer-Moon (7) Gemini-Mercury (8) Taurus-Venus and (9) Aries-

Mars.

Described an order of dasas for the 4 padas of Aswini, BHarani, Rohini and 

Mrigasira, there are In all 27 nakshatras. For the remaining 23 nakshatras (each has 

four  padas)  the  order  of  their  dasas  will  be  the  same  as  for  the  above  four 

nakshatras as explained below:—

(a) The order of the dasas of the four padas of Krittika. Punarvasu, Ashlesha, 

Hasta, Swati, Moola, Uttarashada, Poorvabhadra and Revati will be the same as for 

Aswini.

(b)  The  order  of  the  dasas  of  the  four  padas  of  Pushyami,  Chittra, 

Poorvashada, Uttarabhadra will be the same as for Bharani.

(c) The order of the dasas of the four padas of Magha, Visakha and Sravana 

will be the same as for Rohinl.

(d)  The order  of the dasas of the four padas of Aridra,  Poorva-phalguni, 

Uttaraphalguni, Anuradha, Jyestha, Dhanishta and Shatabhisha will be the same as 

for Mrigasira.

10. The initial Mahadasha of a life belongs to the lord of the sign owning the 

212



nakshatra pada occupied by the Moon at the time of birth, being so much of the 

sign Mahadasha as corresponds to the Ghatlkas that yet remain of the nakshatra 

pada and the order of Mahadashas follows the natural order of the nakshatra pada 

reckoned from the aforesaid one. This is the opinion, say the sages, held by some 

learneds in Astrology.

11. There are number of formulas each composed of a number of mnemonic 

syllables, refering to the several nakshatra padas beginning with the first pada of 

Aswini and giving signs in a certain order. It is with reference to the order of sign 

in these formulas that the rasi Mahadashas of which a life is to consist should be 

determined. The Vakyakrama, men of one school say, should be adhered to.

12.  In  the  order  of  sign Vakyakrama,  the  function at  the  end of  Cancer, 

Scorpio and Pisces give rise to (1) Manduka gati, (2) Aswa or Turaga gati and (3) 

Simhavalokana respectively and the dasas of those intervals cause woeful effects.

13. The sub-period of any of the planets constituting a Mahadasha is thus 

obtained. Find out the mnemonic syllable (out of the nine syllables) composing a 

formula whose sub-period is wanted and find out the owner of the sign signified by 

that syllable. Multiply the number of years assigned to this planet by the number of 

years fixed for the planet whose Mahadasha is under consideration and divide the 

product by the total of years constituting the entire Ayus of the formula chakra. The 

quotient in years etc., will represent the sub-period required.

14.  The total  number of  years  indicated by the  Sun of  nine mnemonical 

syllables of any formula represent the number In years of Parama Ayus for that 

formula. Thus the Parama Ayus in years for the 12 Rasiamsas reckoned from Aries 

in an Apasavya Chakra will be 100, 85, 83, 86 repeated thrice while those for the 

12 Rasiamsas reckoned from Scorpio in a Savya Chakra will be the same but in the 

reverse order, that is 86, 83, 85 and 100 repeated thrice.

Utpanna, Adhana and Kshema Mahadashas

15.  Whatever  effects  have  been  declared  by  me  in  the  case  of  several 

Mahadashas (dasas), the same should be stated by wise astrologer in the cases of 

these dasas also.

213



16. Which is the 5th nakshatra from the Janma nakshatra? The Mahadasha 

coming  from  such  counting  is  known  as  Utpanna  Mahadasha.  Count  the  8th 

nakshatra  from  the  Janma  nakshatra.  The  Mahadasha  commencing  from  this 

nakshatra is known as Adhana dasa. Similarly the dasa commencing from the 4th 

nakshatra from the Janma nakshatra is known as Kshema dasa.

If  all,  these  three  dasas  operate  at  the  same time (year,  month.etc.),  that 

period may cause the death of the native. The third dasa for the Alpayu class, the 

5th  dasa  for  the  Madhyayu  class  and  the  7th  dasa  for  Deerghayu  class  are 

considered as maraka dasas (death inflicting dasas).

Nisarga dasa

17. The years of dasa allotted in Naisargika dasa to the various planets are as 

follows—The  Moon  1  Year,  Mars  2  Years,  Mercury  9  years,  Venus  20  years, 

Jupiter  18 years,  the Sun 20 years,  Saturn 50 years.  According to Yavanas the 

Lagna dasa Is included in the 50 years of Saturn dasa. This is not accepted by 

others.  A well  placed planet in a nativity produces favourable effects while the 

effects of the one adversely placed will not be auspicious. The dasas play their part 

in the order given here according to the natural strength of the planets concerned.

Amsa dasa

18. Convert the rasi, degree and minutes into minutes. Divide that by 2400. 

The  remainder  indicates  the  Ayush  kala.  yielded  by  the  planet.  Divide  these 

Ayuskalas by 200. The quotient will represent the number of years. Multiply the 

remainder  by  12  and  divide  the  product  by  200.  The  quotient  =  months.  The 

remainder should be multiplied by 30 and the product should be divided by 200. 

Quotient  = days.  This  is  the view of Satyacharya.  If  a  planet  is  in his  sign of 

exaltation  or  retrograde  the  years,  months  and days  yielded  by  him should  be 

trebled. If the planet be in his own navamsa, decanate or Vargottama the years, 

months and days yielded by him should be doubled. If the planet be in his sign of 

debilitation  or  eclipsed,  the  years,  months  and days  yielded  by him should  be 

reduced to half.  But this  procedure of reduction of the dasa period of eclipsed 

planets does not apply to Venus and Saturn.

214



19. When malefic planets occupy the 6 houses counted backwards from the 

12th, the whole, a  half,  a  third,  a  fourth, a fifth and sixth respectively of their 

Ayurdaya is lost. When benefic planets occupy such positions, the loss is half of 

that incured in the case of malefic ones. When several planets are in a house, only 

the strongest of them causes a reduction in Ayurdaya. All planets except Mars lose 

a third of their Ayurdaya when in inimical houses. The number of years contributed 

by  the  Lagna  according  to  Satyacharya's  view  corresponds  to  the  number  of 

navamsas that have risen. Even if the Lagna be strong or of medium strength, the 

same rule holds.

20.  The  rule  of  Satyacharya  is  prefered  (to  that  laid  down  by  Maya  or 

Jeevasarman).  But  some make  the  process  inconsistent  and  unwarantable  by  a 

series  of  multiplications.  The  dictim  of  Acharyas  (Satya  and  others)  is  the 

following.

(1) When several multiplications crop up, only one that is the niftiest, to be 

gone through.

For instance when a planet is in his own house, and in his exaltation and in 

retrograde  motion,  the  Ayurdaya  is  not  to  be  doubled  first  and  then  the  result 

trebled and the second result further trebled. According to the rule, the Ayurdaya 

should be trebled once for all.

(2) Again, when there are several reductions applicable, only one, that the 

greatest should be made.

For instance a planet may be in an inimical sign and may be eclipsed by the 

Sun, it is enough if the reduction by half i.e. Astangata reduction be made.

(this verse is from Brihat Jataka Chapter 13). 

Pindayur Dam

21. If  the Sun and other  planets are in their  deep exaltation,  the number 

Pindayurdaya Year allotted them are as follows — The Sun 19, The Moon 25, 

Mars 15,  Mercury 12,  Jupiter  15,  Venus 21,  and Saturn 20.  All  the  reductions 

should be gone through as before. When a malefic planet is posited in the lagna, 

take only  the  degrees,  minutes etc.,  indicating  the  lagna  leaving out  the  signs. 

215



Multiply the total ayus by this and divide by 300. The whole Ayurdaya should be 

reduced by this  result.  If  the  lagna be aspected by a  benefic,  the  period to  be 

reduced will be only half of the above result. So say those well versed in Ayurdaya 

system.

22. In the Pindayurdaya system when Amsa (lagna navamsa) is stronger the 

lagna ayus (or lagna dasa) corresponds to the lagna navamsa. When lagna (sign) is 

strong, the number of years for lagna corresponds to the number signified by the 

sign etc., counted frorn Aries and not the lagna navamsa.

23. The years assigned to the several planets in verse 21 are to be adopted in 

full when they are in exaltation. When a planet is in his point of debilitation, the 

period  assigned  to  him is  reduced  by  half;  when  he  occupies  an  intermediate 

position, the reduction is to be proportionate, say the wise.

24.  The  Pindayurdaya  system  is  advocated  as  the  best  by  Manitha, 

Chanakya, Maya and others. But Satyacharya has pronounced this method to be 

faulty and Varahamihira has also made similar pronouncement.

25.  Jeevasharma lays  down in  according  with  his  own doctrine  that  the 

maximum period of life given by each planet from the Sun onwards is 1/7th of the 

maximum aggregate period (120 years and 5 days). In this Ayurdaya also all the 

reductions are enjoined. The lagna Ayur should be calculated in the same way as in 

the other system.

26. The full period of life in the case of men has been declared as 120 years 

(12 x 10) by some. There are others who have stated that the full period will be the 

time taken by Saturn to make 3 complete revoluation (in his orbit). There is a third 

school according to which the full life period of man is the time taken by the Moon 

for making 1000 revolutions. But we are of the opinion that the full period of man's 

life in this kaliyuga is only 100 years as stated in the Vedas.

27. Of the lagna. the Sun and the Moon whichever is strongest will have his 

dasa first.  Then will  come the dasa of the planet  in kendra and other  position. 

When several occupy any one these positions the preference will be given to the 

planet who predominates in strength. When they happen to be equal in strength, 

216



that who gives longer period, in years of Ayurdaya will have his turn first. When 

there is equality even in regard to the number of years of Ayurdaya of the planets, 

that who rises first after being eclipsed by the Sun, gets his dasa prior to others.

If  such  planets  should,  however,  chance  to  have  equal  strength,  equal 

Ayurdaya and equal  rising after their  conjunction with the Sun. then the planet 

which  is  anterior  in  the  general  order  of  precedence  among  the  significations 

would rule the dasa in question,  and this  general  order of procedure is  usually 

taken to the (1) the lagna, (2) the Sun. (3) the Moon, (4) Mars, (5) Mercury, (6) 

Jupiter, (7) Venus and (8) Saturn.

And the strength of any planet for this purpose is obtained by multiplying 

his  position  by  the  distance  of  the  planet  from his  nearest  Bhava-Sahdhi  and 

dividing the product by the distance between the Bhavamsa and one of its Sandhis.

28. Amsayurdaya is to be calculated upon the predominance in strength of 

the  lagna.  Pindayurdaya  upon  the  Sun's  superiority  in  strength  and 

Naisargikayurdaya when the Moon's power is strongest. We shall now state what 

should be done when the three (lagna, the Sun and the Moon) are of equal strength.

29. Add the three Ayurdays and divide the sum by 3. The quotient will be the 

Ayurdaya required. If only two of them are strong, add the two Ayurdayas and take 

half the result. When the three planets are all weak, adopt the method advocated by 

Jeevasharma for finding out the Ayurdaya.

30. Kalachkra dasa system has to be resorted to only when the lord of the 

navamsa occupied by the Moon is strong. The dasa calculation as per nakshatra 

method is always considered as the best.

31. The full period of life in the case of man and elephant is given as 120 

years and 5 days while in horses it is 32 years. It is 25 years in the case of asses 

and camels and 24 for bulls and buffaloes. Twelve years are allotted for dogs and 

16 years for sheep and like.

32. This Ayus span of life has been declared by wise men with respect to 

only those who are  engaged in the practice  of  various  actions,  who keep their 

senses under control, who eat wholesome diet, who are devoted to the Vedic class 

217



and the gods and who preserve the landmark of character and conduct peculiar to 

their high family.

Chapter 23

Ashtakavarga

The planets are always round the orbit influencing persons favourably and 

unfavourably. These influences are known as transit effects. Generally the transit 

effects are gauged from the sign in which the Moon is posited, for example, there 

is inauspicions effect of the transit of Jupiter in the 4th house and 6th house from 

the Moon while his transit to the 5th house from the Moon produces auspicious 

effects.

In the consideration of transit effects the planet's natal position remains the 

same. It is only when the transit effects are to be ascertained their present position 

is taken into account. This information is available in Panchanga or Ephemeris. As 

has been said ahove, it is usual to assess the transit effects of a planet from his 

position from the Moon. The question arises as to whether Jupiter who gives evil 

effects from his position from the Moon but if Jupiter is well placed from the other 

planets  in  the  natal  chart,  will  he still  produce  the  same evil  effects.  Take the 

reverse of it. Suppose that Jupter in his transit is at an auspicious place from the 

natal Moon but is not in auspicious position from the natal Sun, Mars, Mercury, 

Jupiter, Venus and Saturn and the Lagna. Will the Jupiter be treated as auspicious? 

The intention of mentioning all this is that there is a system under which the effects 

of planets are ascertained by the position in transit not only from their position 

from the Moon but also with reference to the Lagna and all  other planets with 

referense to  their  placement  in the  natal  chart.  This  is  called the  Ashtakavarga 

System.

Ashtaka means eight. These eight are the Lagna and the seven planets. The 

planet which is in an auspicious position from more of the eight viz., Lagna and 

the seven planets, should be considered beneficial in his effects.

1. In order to ascertain the good and had effects by the several planets in 

their transit through the signs of the Zodiac, the Ashtakavarga system has been 

very  highly  spoken  of  the  great  sages  and  I  now  set  forth  the  mode  of 

219



accomplishing it. Notes — The meaning of Ashtakavarga is literally the group of 8 

things. In other words, it is the combination of the good and bad positions of a 

planet with respect to the 7 planets and the Lagna (8 things). So is the combination 

of benefic and malefic dots in a native's chart with reference to these 8 planets 

(here Lagna is also treated as a planet).

2. In the ancient times the Rasi chakra etc., were drawn on the ground and 

the places where dots are to be indicated were shown by placing beads but now we 

use pen and paper and dots are marked at the places where beads are to be placed. 

Although in  the  verses  the  word 'beads'  has  been used,  we in  own translation 

replace 'beads' with 'dots' or bindus.

Draw  a  horoscope  on  a  paper  and  place  the  all  seven  planets  at  their 

appropriate  positions.  Suppose  we have  to  prepare  Ashtakavarga  chakra  of  the 

horoscopoe given below. Rahu and Ketu being shadowy planets have no place in 

the  Ashtakarvarga  chart.  First  we will  describe  how the  Sun's  Ashtakavarga  is 

prepared.

3-5-6-11 places from himself and in 1-3-4-6-10-11 places from the Lagna.

Thus the total number of benefic bindus obtained by Saturn is 39 as detailed 

below :

From the Sun 7,  from the Moon 3, from Mars 6, from Mercury 6, from 

Jupiter 4, from Venus 3, from himself 4 and from the Lagna 6.

Note  -  In  the  above  Ashtakavargas  where  the  benefic  bindus  have  been 

marked the planet will produce good effects while transiting the house concerned. 

It will produce evil effects when transiting the houses without benefic Bindus. For 

example, when Saturn in the course of his transit passes through 1-2-4-7-8-10-11 

places from the Sun, he produces benefic effects. In the example horoscope, the 

Sun is in Scorpio, therefore, from the Sun 1 Scorpio, 2 Sagittarius, 4 Aquarius, 7 

Taurus, 8 Gemini. 10 Leo and 11 Virgo are favourable places for the transit of 

Saturn. He will not produce benefic effects while transiting other places viz, Aries, 

Cancer, Libra, Capricorn and Pisces. The same should apply to the other planets 

including the Lagna. The number of benefic bindus has also its significance.

The planet will produce full benefic effects while passing through the house 

with 8 benefic blndus. He will produce adverse effects where there are no benefic 

bindus. When there are four benefic blndus. In respect of four planets, the effects 

will be benefic and in respect of the other four, the effects will be adverse (8th 

include the  Ascendant).  In  the  Ashtakavarga  of  Saturn  shown above,  there  are 

seven  benefic  blndus  In  Leo.  That  sign  proves  adverse  from  Venus  for  the 

transiting Saturn.  It  will  be seen from the example birth chart  that Venus is  in 

Scorpio and from him the benefic places for Saturn are 6-11-12. Leo is 10th from 

Scorpio. It is on this account in the Saturn's Ashtakavarga he acquires 10 benefic 

bindus, as these are benefic dots for the transiting Saturn from the Sun, the Moon, 

Mars,  Mercury,  Jupiter,  Saturn  and  the  Lagna.  Quite  good  results  will  accrue 

because of 7 bindus. The sign which contains only 1 benefic Bindu, the Saturn 

while in transit to that sign will produce very adverse effects. Medium effects may 

be expected in case of 4 benefic bindus. Increasingly good effects may be expected 

when there are 4 or more benefic bindus and increasingly bad effects from signs 

225



containing less than 4 bindus.

10. As explained in the notes above the planets produce good or bad effects 

as the case may be, which ever may preponderate in the Ashtakavarga calculations 

from the signs they occupy at the time of birth; but two things are to be kept in 

mind - (a) If a planet in course of transit passes through his own sign, his sign of 

exaltation, his friend's sign or an upachaya house, he causes reduction in the evil 

effects and enhancement of the benefic effects.

Notes — For example in course of his transit a planet in his own sign, sign 

of  exaltation,  friend's  sign  or  upachaya  house,  which  contains  only  3  benefic 

bindus the bad effects will be substantially neutralised. If there be 5 benefic bindus, 

the auspicious results will be enhanced.

(b) If a planet in course of his transit passes through his sign of debilitation, 

enemy's sign or Anupachaya, producing evil effects because of insufficient benefic 

bindus,  these effects  will  be enchanced by such a  transit  If  there  are  adequate 

number of benefic bindus or more expected to produce good effects, these good 

effects will be reduced by such a transit.

11. When all the Ashtakavargas have been prepared it should have been seen 

how many bindus the various signs contain. The native may suffer loss of his life if 

the particular planet in course of his transit  passes through with no bindu. The 

effects according to the author in accordance with the number of bindus will be as 

under :—

1. Bindu Destruction or loss 
2. Bindus Expenditure 
3. Bindus Fear 
4. Bindus Accomplishment of the desired 

object 
5. Bindus Acquisition of a beautiful wife 
6. Bindus Gain of wealth or property 
7. Bindus Acquisition of a kingdom or high 

government position. 

12. The various signs occupied by the planets at the time of birth should be 

treated as Lagnas and benefic bindus should be compounded in 8 ways due to the 

226



countings by houses from the each of the seven planets and the Lagna and effects 

should be assessed of the various houses counted from that planet on the basis of 

bindus they contain.

Notes — For example in  the  Sun's  Ashtakavarga,  the  Sun is  in Scorpio. 

According to the author this should be treated as the Lagna as shown below:

When the Sun in the course of his transit passes through a house containing 

4 or more bindus, benefic effects may be expected. Thus when the Sun transits 

Taurus which contains 7 bindus, excellent results will be produced in respect of 

that house (which counted from the Sun will be the house of marriage conjugal life 

etc.). There is only one bindu, in the house 5th from the Sun. The transit of the Sun 

to that house will cause trouble in respect of children, stomach, disorders, mental 

worry etc.

13. This verse explains as to when a planet will reduce good or bad effects 

of a house according to the number of bindus it contains.

Note the sign and navamsa occupied by a planet at birth. When the planet in 

the course of his transit passes through so much distance in that house, he produces 

the effects of that house good or bad as the case may be.

Note — For example in the example horoscope the longitude of Jupiter is 14 

degrees. In the Jupiter's Ashtakavarga, Virgo centals 7 bindus. Jupiter in the course 

of his transit to Virgo will produce good effects due from the number of bindus 

when he has traversed 14 degrees in that sign.

227



14. After the preparation of the Ashtakavarga of any planet, it should be seen 

which house contains the highest number of bindus and what house it is from the 

house occupied by the karaka planet which is to be treated as the Lagna or the first 

house.  When a planet  — malefic or  benefic in the course of his  transit  passes 

through that house, he enchances its good effects. The reverse will be the case 

when the planet in the course of his transit passes through a house containing few 

or no benefic bindus.

15.  When a number of  planets  in course of  their  transits  pass through a 

house containing a good number of benefic bindus in the Ashtakavarga of a planet, 

they produce substantially good results of the house, the countig being reckoned 

from  the  house  occupied  by  the  karaka  planet  whose  Ashtakavarga  is  under 

consideration. The previous verse gives the time of position of benefic bindus in a 

house. We give below the Prastar Ashtakavarga of Saturn

Saturn remains In a sign for 2 1/2 years. When will he produce his good or 

bad effects. One way to find out this has been given in verse.

16-19. To ascertain the same draw a table of 96 squares and suppose we 

have to find out the effects of Saturn's transit, prepare a table for Saturn as given 

above. It has been stated that in preparing Saturn's Ashtakavarga benefic bindus 

will  fall  in 1-2-4-7-10-11 house from the Sun.  The Sun is  in Scorpio,  so from 

Scorpio  the  1-2-4-7-10-11  houses  will  fall  in  Sagittarius,  Aquarius,  Taurus, 

Gemini, Leo and Virgo. Put benefic bindus in these places. Similar benefic bindus 

228



should be placed. Saturn Ashtakavarga has to be prepared in this manner.

Divide sign into  8  divisions.  Each division will  be of  3  degrees  and 45 

minutes. Whatever be the sign the first division belongs to Saturn. Thus Saturn is 

the lord of the first division of 3 degrees and 45 minutes. The 2nd, 3nd, 4th, 5th, 

6th 7th and 8th divisions are owned by Jupiter, Mars, the Sun, Venus, Mercury, the 

Moon and the Lagna. This is why in the above Saturn's Ashtakavarga the order of 

planets in the table is Saturn, Jupiter, Mars, the Sun, Venus, Mercury, the Moon 

and the Lagna.  It  will  be seen that  in  Leo there  are  benefic  bindus of  Saturn, 

Jupiter, Mars, the Sun, Mercury and the Lagna. When Saturn in the course of his 

transit passes through these divisions, benefic effects will be produced. There will 

be adverse effects when Saturn passes through the division of Venus because his 

division is deviod of benefic bindus

This is the sense of the verses 16-19.

20. The Sarvashtakavarga containing the results of Ashtakavargas of all the 

planets is prepared by putting in each sign the sum total of all the figures in the 

seven Ashtakavargas. If a sign contains figures exceeding 28, the results of the 

transit in that sign will be auspicious. If the number of figures be less than 28, it 

should be understood that  effects  of  transit  of  planets  in  the  sign will  produce 

danger or sorrow, the intensity of diversity being in proportion in the number.

Notes — We would better clarify this how the sarvashtakavarga is prepared. 

In accordance with the example the Ashtakavargas of the Seven planets, show the 

benefic bindus as under:—

21. There are two principles laid down in this verse —

(1) If in the auspicious houses reckoned from the Moon, there be more than 

28 benefic dots, such houses flourish, the houses are harmed if the benefic dots be 

less than 28.

(2) Note which houses reckoned from the Moon are occupied by benefic 

planets.  If  there be more than 28 benefic dots in such houses, their  effects get 

promoted. The effects of the houses will cause damage if the benefic dots be less 

than 28.

22.  The  Ashtakavarga  figures  are  to  be  computed  according  to  rules 

prescribed in this chapter with respect to the positions of planets (existing) at the 

time of birth of any person, is that particular rasi, month, hour etc. signified by the 

sign containing the greatest number of benefic dots, one ought to get performed 

anything auspicious when the planets concerned transit those houses.

23. The effects of the house will be promoted even if it be occupied by a 

malefic  if  such  a  planet  be  in  his  own  house.  If  a  planet  be  in  his  sign  of 

debilitation or in his enemy's house, the house occupied by him will be damaged.

24.  If  a  benefic  planet  happens  to  own a  dusthana  (6th,  8th,  12th)  will 

destroy  the  house  occupied  by  him even  if  he  may  be  occupying  his  sign  of 

exaltation. A malefic in exaltation will do good to the house occupied by him if he 

happens to own good houses.

Thus  ends  the  twenty  third  chapter  on  "Ashtakavarga"  in  Phaladeepika 

composed by Mantreswara.

Chapter 24

Effects of Ashtakavarga according to Horasara

Note  — Horasara  is  a  recognised  work  on  Hindu  Astrology  written  by 

Prithuyasas, son  of  Varahamlhira.  Its  English  translation  done  by  Mr.  R. 

Santhanam has been published by Ranjan Publications, the Publishers of this book.

1. The 9th sign reckoned from the sign occupied by the Sun is called the 

house of lather. Multiply the benefic bindus in that house by the figure denoting 

the Sodhyapinda

Note — After the trikona and ekadhipatya reductions have been made in any 

Ashtaka Varga, the sum-total of all the remaining figures is called the sodhyapinda 

in that Ashtakavarga (vide verse 3 infra).

2. The figure so arrived at should be divided by 27. When Saturn passes 

through  the  nakshatra  represented  by  treat  figure,  in  course  of  his  transit, 

something untoward will happen to the father of the native.

3. Or when Saturn in the course of his transit passes through the nakshatra in 

trine to the nakshatra aforesaid, the death of the father or a similar elderly relation 

may be expected. The sum-total of the figures remaining after the 2 reductions is 

known a sodhyapinda.

4. The death of the father takes place in the dasa of the lord of the navamsa 

in which the lord of the 4th house is posited. The same may happen to the father or 

a similar elderly relative of the native in the dasa of the lord of the 4th house.

5-6.  Add 8 to the sodhyapinda  of the Sun's  Ashtakavarga and divide  the 

figure so arrived at by 12. When the Sun passes in the course of his transit through 

the sign represented by the remainder (counted from Aries) or its triangular sign, 

the death of the father may be expected. A wise man should thus fix up with the 

helptof all the other planets the demise in other cases.

7. Multiply the number of benefic bindus in the sign 4th from the Moon. In 

the  Ashtakavarga  of  the  Moon,  by  the  figure  of  the  sodhyapinda  in  the 

Ashtakavarga of the Moon. Divide the product by 27. When Saturn in the course of 

232



his  transit  passes  through the  nakshatra  represented by  the  remainder  (counted 

from Aswini) or its triangular nakshatra, the death of the mother may be expected.

8. Note the position in navamsas of the lords of the 4th and the 8th houses 

from the Moon. The death of the mother of the native takes place, when the Sun in 

the course of his transit passes through a position triangular to those, the death of 

the mother may be expected.

Note the position of the navamsas of the lord of the 4th and the 8th houses 

from the Lagna. The death of the father takes place when the Sun in the course of 

his transit passes through a position triangular to these navamsa signs.

9. In the Ashtakavarga of Mars, note the number of benefic bindus in the 

sign 3rd to the sign occupied by Mars. The native will have the same number of 

brothers.

In the Ashtakavarga of Mercury, note the number of benefic bindus in the 

house 4th to that occupied by Mercury. The native will have the same number of 

relations or maternal uncles.

10. In the Ashtakavarga of Jupiter, the number of children will be the same 

as the number of benefic bindus in the house 5th to that occupied by Jupiter. From 

that  number  take  away  as  many  benefic  bindus  of  planets  as  are  occupying 

inimical or depression houses. The remainder will represent the number of children 

the native may expect.

11. In the Ashtakavarga of Jupiter add up all the benefic bindus remaining 

after the trikona and ekadhipatya sodhana and from this sum deduct the number of 

bindus in the malefic signs. The number of the children the native will have will be 

represented by the remainder.

12. In the Ashtakavarga of Venus note the sign containing the largest number 

of benefic bindus. If the wile of the native be born in the direction of the quarter 

indicated by that sign, increase of progeny through her is assumed. If the number 

of benefic bindus be meagre, wealth or progeny through her will be poor.

13. In the Ashtakavarga of Saturn, multiply the sodhyapinda figure by the 

number of benefic bindus In the house 8th from the Lagna and divide the product 

233



by 27. The death of the native may be expected when Jupiter  or Saturn In the 

course of his transit passes through the nakshatra (counted from Aswini) indicated 

by the remainder.

14. In the Ashtakavarga of Saturn add up the number of benefic bindus in 

the houses from the Lagna to that occupied by Saturn both Inclusive. In the same 

way  add  up  the  benefic  bindus  in  the  houses  from Saturn  to  the  Lagna  both 

Inclusive.  The  years  indicated  by  these  figures  will  bring  distress,  danger  or 

disaster to the native.

15. The figure Indicating the sodhyapinda In the Ashtakavarga of Saturn be 

multiplied by the figure indicated by the number of benefic bindus in the 8th house 

form the Lagna. Divide the product by 27. The figure so arrived at will indicate 

total number of years of the longevity of the native. The time of death may be 

determined according to principles already described (see verse 13).

Tiikona sodhana

16-17.  Note  —  Now  we  come  to  the  method  of  working  out  trikona 

sodhana. This, is an important part of the ashtakavarga scheme. Before we come to 

what Shri Mantreshwara has said about it, we will acquaint the readers with some 

points which will facilitate the clear understanding of the trikona sodhana.

Aries, Leo and Sagittarius are triangular signs: The other triangular signs are 

Aries, Virgo and Capricorn; Gemini. Libra and Aquarius and Cancer, Scorpio and 

Pisces.

We have already described how the Ashtakavarga is prepared there are seven 

Ashtakavargas viz., those of the Sun, the Moon, Mars. Mercury, Jupiter and Saturn. 

Trikona sodhana (rectification) is carried out in all the seven Ashtakavargas. For 

example, if we have to carry out trikona sodhana of the Sun's Ashtakavarga, we 

should note the number of benefic bindus in all the three triangular signs — Aries, 

Leo and Sagittarius.

There are 3 benefic bindus in Aries, 5 in Leo and 4 in Sagittarius.

There is great difference of opinion amongst the ancient learneds about the 

method of trikona sodhana. They are given below:

234



(1) The first view is that amongst the three signs deduct the figure of least 

number of bindus in a sign from the figures of bindus of the other two signs. In the 

Sun's Ashtakavarga Aries has 3 bindus, Leo 5 and Sagittarius 4. Amongst these 

three signs Aries has the least number of bindus. Deduct this from the figures of 

Leo's bindus viz., 5 i.e. 5-3=2. Similarly deduct 3 from 4 the figure of bindus of 

Sagittarius, that is 4-3=1. In Aries there will be 3-3=0

Similarly in the next set of triangular signs Taurus, Virgo and Capricorn, 

Taurus has 7 bindus, Virgo 3 and Capricorn 3. Virgo and Capricorn has the least 

number  of  bindus.  Thus  as  result  of  trikona  sodhana  Taurus  will  have  7-3=4 

bindus, Virgo 3-3=0 bindus and Capricorn 3-3=0 bindus.

As regards Gemini, Libra and Aquarius, Gemini has 4, Libra 4 and Aquarius 

6 in the Sun's Ashtakavarga. Gemini and Libra have the least number of bindus. 

Therefore as a result of trikona sodhana Aquarius will have 5-4=1, Libra 4-4=0 and 

Gemini 4-4 = 0 bindus.

SARVASHTAKAVARGA

Sun 3 7 4 4 5 3 4 5 4 3 5 1 48 
Moon 4 5 4 4 6 6 3 1 3 6 3 4 49 
Mars 4 4 3 2 5 4 4 2 2 4 3 2 39 
Mercury 4 5 4 4 5 6 4 5 5 4 4 4 54 
Jupiter 5 5 4 4 7 7 2 5 6 5 3 3 56 
Venus 4 3 6 5 5 4 5 4 3 4 6 3 52 
Saturn 2 4 3 1 7 6 4 3 1 3 3 2 39 
Total 26 33 28 24 40 36 26 25 24 29 27 19 337 

In the fourth set of triangular signs in the the Sun's Ashtakavarga, Cancer has 

4, Scorpio 5 and Pisces 1. Pisces has the Least number of bindus. Therefore as a 

result of trikona sodhana. Cancer will be 4-1=3, Scorpio 5-1=4 and Pisces 1-1=0 

bindus.

Thus the following principles are to be observed in trikona sodhana:—

(a)  Of  the  three  triangular  signs,  the  figure  of  the  sign  having  the  least 

number of bindus, has to be deducted from the figures of all  the signs and the 

remainder will represent the final rectified figure of the signs.

235



(b) No change is necessary in the figures of the other signs if one of the 

signs has 0 bindus.

(e) If the figures of all the three signs are the same, then that figure should 

be deducted from the feaures of all the seris, that result having been that all the 

signs will have Zero as remainders.

Above view is  that  of Parasara.  Now we give another  view in regard to 

trikona sodhana.

Suppose we have to do trikona sodhana in the Sun's Ashtakavarga. Aries has 

3 bindus, Leo 5 and Sagittarius 4. The smallest figure is 3. Therefore according to 

this view the figures of all the three signs should be adopted as 3.

Taurus has 7 bindus, Virgo 3 and Capricorn 3. 3 being the smallest figure, 

this may be adopted for all the three signs.

In the Sun's Ashtakavarga, Gemini has 4, Libra 4 and Aquarius 5. 4 should 

be adopted for all these three signs.

Cancer has 4, Scorpio 5 and Pisces 1 bindus. Here the figure 1 should be 

adopted for all the three signs.

The above is the view of Shri Balabhadra as given in his book Hora Ratna.

Now we give the view of Shri Mantreshwara as laid down in verses 16-17.

(1) Of the three signs in a trikona group, find which sign contains the least 

number of benefic bindus. The figures in the other two sings should be reduced to 

that extent. If there be no bindus in any sign, no such reduction will be necessary in 

the other two signs of the triangular group.

(2) If there be no bindus in two of the signs of a group, remove the figures in 

the third. When all the three signs of a group have the same number of bindus, 

remove all.

Notes — Here it will be relevant to quote the views of Jataka Parijat also (1) 

In the Ashtakavarga of any one of the Sun and other planets take the signs by the 

triangular  groups  (i)  Aries,  Leo,  Sagittarius,  (ii)  Taurus,  Virgo,  Capricorn  (iii) 

Gemini, Libra, Aquarius and (iv) (Cancer, Scorpio and Pisces; and examine the 

benefic bindus in the 3 signs composing any group. If in any one sign of a group, 

236



the number of benefic bindus be less than that in each of the remaining two, or 

equal  to  that  in  each  of  the  other  two  or  be  zero,  the  same  will  have  to  be 

substracted from the number of benefic bindus in each of the three signs of the 

group chosen.

(2) If a sign in a triangular group has the least number of bindus, the other 

two signs must have their benefic bindus altered into this least number. If a sign 

has  no  benefic  bindus,  the  remaining signs  of  the  same group will  keep their 

figures unaltered. If all the signs of a triangular group have the same number of 

benefic bindus they must all be removed (i.e., replaced by zero).

Ekadhipatya Sodhana

18. Ekadhipatya sodhana should be undertaken after carrying out the trikona 

sodhana. When both the houses owned by a planet contain benefic bindus, then 

only this rectification would be called for.

19. Of the two signs having a common lord, if one alone be occupied and 

contain a less number of benefic bindus than the number in the other, the figure in 

the latter is to be made equal to the former.

20. If one of the two signs owned by the same planet be occupied and has 

more benefic bindus than the other, remove the figure in the latter. If two signs 

only one of which is occupied, contain the same number of benefic bindus, the 

figure in the unoccupied sign should be removed.

21. If both the signs owned by a planet be unoccupied and have the same 

number of benefic bindus, the figures of both should be removed. If both the signs 

owned by a planet, be occupied by planets, no rectification will be necessary.

22. No rectification is called for if one of the two signs (whether occupied or 

unoccupied), contain no benefic dots. If both the signs be unoccupied and have an 

unequal number of benefic bindus the greater figure is to be replaced by the lesser 

one.

23.  The  net  figure  after  the  two  rectifications  in  the  several  signs  are 

required to be multiplied each into its sign factors (Rasi mana). The net figures in 

the signs that are associated with the Sun and other planets are to be multiplied by 

237



the appropriate planetary factors (or Grahamana).

The multipliers of the signs and planets 25. The multipliers of the various 

signs are as under

Aries 7 Libra 7 
Taurus 10 Scorpio 8 
Gemini 8 Sagittarius 9 
Cancer 4 Capricorn 5 
Leo 10 Aquarius 11 
Virgo 5 Pisces 12 

These are called sign or rasi multipliers. The multipliers in respect of the 

planets are different.

26. The multipliers of the various planets are as under:

Sun 5 Jupiter 10 
Moon 5 Venus 7 
Mars 8 Saturn 5 
Mercury 5   

The  multiplication  by  the  planet  or  Graha  factors  should  be  effected 

separately and should be treated as distinct from the sign or rasi. Multiplication.

27.  After  multiplying  and then adding the  two products,  the total  should 

again be multiplied by 7 and divided by 27. The quotient obtained will be the Ayus 

(span of life) in years contributed by that planet.

28.  The  remainder  multiplied  by  12  and divided  by 27 will  indicate  the 

months. The remaindec after this operation should be multiplied by 30 and divided 

by 27 to get the days and to get the Ghatikas etc., 27 years constitute a mandala 

Some reductions have to be made further.

29-30. The period contributed by a planet has to be reduced as follows:

(1) By half if the planet is in conjuction with another planet.

(2) By half if the planet is in his sign of debilitation or combust.

(3) By one third if the planet occupies an inimical sign

238



(4)  By  one  third  if  the  planet  occupies  house  in  the  visible  half  of  the 

horizon.

(5) By one third if a planet gets defeated in planetary war or occupies a 

position within the Pata range of the Sun and the Moon.

31-32.  When several  reductions have to be made in the case of  a single 

planet, only one and that the greatest should be made. All the figures should then 

be added up and the sum total should be multiplied by 324.

The product should then be divided by 365. The quotient will be the correct 

rectified Ayus contributed severally by the planets and may be shown in years, 

months, days etc., and will be their dasa periods.

33. The dasa periods of each of the serveral planets should be calculated in 

this manner. According to the author the method of calculating the dasa periods by 

the Ashtakavarga process is the best of all.

34-35. In the sarvashtakavarga the figures indicating the number of benefic 

Hindus in the 12 houses reckoned from —

(1) The Sun are 3,3,3,3,2,3,4,5,3,5,7,2 = 43 
(2) The Moon 2,3,5,2,2,5,2,2,2,3,7,1 = 36 
(3) Mars 4,5,3,5,2,3,4,4,4,6,7.2 = 49 
(4) Mercury 3,1,5,2,6,6,1.2,5,5,7,3 = 46 
(5) Jupiter 2.2,1,2,3,4,2,4,2,4,7,3 = 36 
(6) Venus 2,2,3,3,3,4,4,2,3,4,3,4,3,6,3 = 40 
(7) Saturn 3,2,4.4,4,3,3,4,4,4,6,1 = 42 
(8) Lagna 5,3,5,5,2.6,1,2,2,6,7,1 = 45 
 Total Sarvashtakavarga figure = 537 

36.  The  Ashtakavarga  system  considered  as  the  most  effective  for  all 

undertakings. There is no other way to determine the good or bad result of any of 

the event at any time.

37. The signs which have 30 or more benefic bindus always prove benefic. 

The effect will be medium or benefic for bindus between 25 and 30. The houses 

containing less than 25 will cause misery.

38. The native will acquire wealth and will be happy if in his nativity, the 

number of benefic bindus in the 11th house of the sarvashtaka-varga exceeds the 

239



number of bindus in the 10th house and the figure in the 12th less than that of the 

11th, and the figure in the lagna more than that of the 12th.

39. In whichever houses from the lagna to the 12th house the number of 

benefic bindus are more, good results may be expected in the course of the transits, 

when the number is less, only adverse effects will come to pass.

40.  The  principle  laid  down in  the  previous  verse  is  applicable  only  to 

houses  other  than  the  6th,  the  8th  and  the  12th.  All  auspicious  functions  and 

ceremonies  should  be  performed  during  the  transits  through  the  signs  which 

contain greater number of benefic bindus

41-42 The figures in the houses reckoned from the Lagna to Saturn, both 

inclusive, should be added up and the figure so arrived at, be multiplied by 7 and 

the product be divided by 27.

The native will suffer from some calamity or disease in the year signified by 

the quotient. The same process may be adopted in regard to the houses reckoned 

from Saturn to the Lagna. This principle would also apply to Mars and Rahu and 

the years worked out by the method indicated above will bring adverse events for 

the native.

43. The year indicated by the figure obtained by (1) adding the number of 

benefic bindus in the houses occupied by benefic planets and (2) then multiplying 

the same by 7 and (3) dividing the product by 27, will be the year when auspicious 

events will take place, such as, acquiring of issues, wealth and happiness.

44.  In  this  verse  the  author  concludes  to  say  that  in  this  chapter  he has 

described the effects due to Ashtakavarga. The same have been treated in greater 

detail in other works by the learneds in this divine science.

Notes—Readers are advised to refer  to Brihat  Parasara Hora Shastra and 

Jataka Parijata published by Ranjan Publications.

Chapter 25

Calculation of the positions of Gulika

and other Upagrahas and their effects

1. The author in this verse pays obeisance to all the upgrahas viz., (1) Mandi 

(Gulika), (2) Yamakantaka. (3) Ardhaprahara, (4) Kala, (5) Dhooma, (6) Patha or 

Vyatlpatl, (7) Parldhi, (8) Indra Dhanus and (9) Ketu or Upketu.

2. When the duration of the day is 30 ghatikas, the positions of Mandi or 

Gulika on the week days counting from Sunday onwards is at the end of 26, 22, 18, 

14, 10, 6, 2 ghatikasa (from Sunrise) during day time. These figures have to be 

proportionately  increased  or  diminished  according  to  the  duration  of  the  day 

chosen is greater or less than 30 ghatikas. At night (from Sunset) the positions of 

the lord of the seven muhurtas are counted not  from the lord of the week day 

chosen; but that of the 5th. The position of mandi at night will be different on the 

week days viz., at the end of 10, 6, 2, 26, 22, 18 and 14 respectively.

3. The position of Yamakantaka during day time on week days is at the end 

of ghatikas 18, 14,10. 6, 2, 26 and 22; of Ardhapranara, at the end of Ghatikas 14, 

10, 6, 2, 26, 22 and 18.

4. The position of Kala on the week days counting from Sunday onwards is 

at the end of Ghatikas 2, 26. 22, 13, 14, 10 and 6, respectively during day time. 

These figures have, as already stated for Mandi, to be proportionately changed and 

their exact positions fixed as in the case of Lagna.

5. The position of Dhuma is ascertained by adding 4 signs, 13° and 20' to the 

longitude of the Sun. The position of Vyatlpata will be found if the longitude of 

Dhuma is substracted from 12 signs. The position of Paridhi (or Parivesha) can be 

found by adding 6 signs to the figure of Vyatipata. The position of Indra Dhanus 

(or Indra Chapti) is calculated by substracting longitude of Paridhi from 12 signs. 

The position of Upaketu is to be found out by adding 16 degrees and 40 minutes to 

the figure of Indra Dhanus. Upaketu increased by one sign wil give the longitude 

of the Sun.
241



Notes — We will illustrate the above by giving an example:

(1) Sun add 7-26 + Dhuma 
4-13-20
0-9-20 

(2) Subtract the figure 12-0-0 - Vyatipata 
of Dhuma from 12 0-9-20
signs 11-20-40 

(3) Vyatipata + 6 signs 11-20-40 Paridhi 
6-0-0
5-20-40 

(4) Deduct Paridhi 12-0-0 - Indra 
from 12 signs 5-20-40 Dhanus 

6-9-20 
(5) Add 16°-40' to + 16-40 Upaketu 

India Dhanus 6-26-0 
 Add 1 sign to + l-00-0  

Upaketu 
  7-26-0 Sun 

6. In the chapter on 'houses' the effects of these have already been described 

in a collective manner. It is only the effects on the houses of those that have been 

left out there, will be described here in detail.

7. Nevertheless, some special effects of Gulika (Mandi) and other Upagrahas 

which have been described by the ancient learneds, are enumerated here iri brief.

8. If Gulika be in the Lagna, the native will be a thief, cruel and devoid of 

politeness. He will not be very fat. He will have defects in his eyes. He will have 

few issues and little intelligence. He will not take interest in the study of Vedas and 

Shastras. He will eat much but will be unhappy . He does not live long. He will be 

of angry temperament, stupid and a coward. He will be lustful and deprived.

9. If Gulika be in the 2nd house, the native will not have a pleasant manner 

of speech. He will be quarrelsome and will ever remain short of wealth and grain. 

He will mostly live away from his native place. He will not stick to his word and 

will be incapable of discussing things in which the use of intellect is necessary.

10. If Gulika be in the 3rd house, the native will be greedy and voitable. He 

will generally like to lead a lonely life. He will be very fond of liquors. He will get 

little happiness from brothers and sisters.
242



He will  be fearless  and devoid of  sorrow.  He exhibits  ostentation in  the 

acquistion of wealth.

11. If Gulika be In the 4th house, the native will be without relations and 

wealth. He is deprived of comforts of conveyances.

If Gulika be in the 5th house, the native will be badly disposed and fickle 

minded. He will be short lived.

If Gulika be in the 6th house, the native takes interest in demonology. He 

will  be  brave  and  will  vanquish  his  enemies.  He  will  be  blessed  with  a  son 

possessing good qualities.

12. If Gulika be in the 7th house, the native will be quarrelsome and a public 

enemy. He will be dull minded, some what of angry temperament and ungrateful. 

He will have many wives.

13. If Gulika be in the 8th house, the native will be short statured.

He will have a deformed face and impaired eyes.

If Gulika be in the 9th house the native will be devoid of elderly relations or 

preceptor and children.

If Gulika be in the 10th house, the native does not perform auspicious or 

good deeds and will not be charitable.

If  Gulika  be  in  the  11th  house,  the  native  will  be  happy,  powerful  and 

lustreful. He will also be blessed with children.

14. If Gulika be in the 12th house the native will have no liking for sexual 

pleasures. He will be poor and incur heavy expenditure.

The Janma Lagna or Janma Rasi of the native will be a sign that is triangular 

to that occupied by Gulika or the navamsa indentical with the one occupied by 

Mandi.

15. If Gulika be associated with the Sun, The native will have a father who 

will be the cause of the death of his father. If Gulika be with the Moon, the mother 

of the native will be in distress. If Gulika be with Mars, the native will be separated 

from his brothers. If Gulika be with Mercury, the native will become insane.

16. If Gulika be conjoined with Jupiter, the native will be a blasphemous 

243



heretic.

If Gulika be associated with Venus, the native will enjoy the company of low 

class women.

If Gulika be with Saturn the native will be afflicted with leprosy and will be 

short lived.

17. If Gulika be with Rahu, the native will suffer from a disease caused by 

poison.

If Gulika be with Ketu the native will meet with a fine accident.

If Gulika's time on any week day be synchronous with the Tyajykala on the 

that day, the person born then, though a king will become a begger.

18.  The  association  of  Gulika  always  causes  evil  effects.  Wherever 

Yamakantaka is associated good has to be expected.

19. White Gulika is very powerful in causing evil, Yamakantaka is powerful 

in causing good. All the other upagrahas possess only half the power that Mandi 

has in causing evil.

20. In producing effects Gulkia is  similar  to Saturn,  Yamakantaka is  like 

Jupiter. Ardhaprahara acts like Mercury and Kala is like Rahu.

21.  Kala's  effects  will  be just  like Rahu,  while  Gulika is  likely  to  cause 

death, Yamakantaka will produce beneficial results. Ardhaprahara's effects will be 

good if it is posited in a house with many benefic bindus. Its effects will be bad if it 

occupies an inauspicious house.

22.  According  to  Parasara  if  the  other  houses  along  with  their  lords  be 

conjoined with Dhuma and other upagrahas, these houses will be destroyed.

23. Dhuma will always cause trouble from heat, danger from fire and mental 

agony. Yamakantaka in the same position will cause danger from horned animals 

or death through qudrupeds.

24. Paridhi or parvesh will create fear of water and the native will suffer 

from watery  diseases.  He  will  suffer  from imprisonment.  Indrachapa  or  Indra 

Dhanus will get the native hit by a stone and wounded by weapons. He will also 

suffer humiliation.

244



25.  Ketu  or  Upaketu  will  cause  hit,  a  fall  etc.,  and  loss  in  the  native's 

business. He will also be in danger from thunder.

The effects described above will be denried during the dasa period of the 

planet owning the house occupied by the upagraha.

26. The effects of Upaketu in the 12 houses from Lagna will respectively be 

(1)  short  life,  (2)  ugliness,  (3)  valour,  (4)  unhappiness and distress,  (5)  loss of 

issues, (6) disturbance of the mind caused by enemies, (7) decay of sexual power, 

(8) loss of life by indulgence in sinful activities, (9) opposition to virtuous life, (10) 

wanderings, (11) gains and (12) committing faults.

27. The five upagrahas Dhuma etc., traverse the sky are not visible. If at any 

time they are visible any where they foreshadow evil to the world.

28. Some say that Dhuma resembles the shape of fume clouds, while others 

have described it as a star having a tail. Vyatipata is like the fall of a meteor and 

Parvesha or Paridhi is a halo or disc round the Sun or the Moon.

29. Indra Dhanus is the well known rainbow that is generally seen in the sky 

during the advent of rain. Ketu is Dhumaketu causes calamity to the world.

30. If the lord of the house occupied by Gullka be endowed with strength 

and occupies  a kendra,  a trikona,  his own house or  his  sign of  exaltation or  a 

friendly house, the native will enjoy extremely favourable results. He will  own 

chariots (good conveyances), elephants and horses, will be as beautiful as cupid, 

will be held in great esteem, will be very famous and will rule the world.

Thus  ends  the  twenty  fifth  chapter  on  "Upagrahas"  in  Phaladeepika  

composed by Mantreswara.

245



Chapter 26

Effects of transits of the various planets and constellations

1. Among all the Lagnas, the Moon's Lagna (Chandra Lagna or the sign in 

which the Moon is posited), is most important for assessing the effects of transits 

(Gocharaphalam). It is, therefore, imperative to make predictions about effects of 

the transits of planets through various signs from the sign occupied by the Moon.

2.  The  various  planets  give  results  while  transiting  the  following  places 

counted from the Moon.

The Sun - the 3rd, 6th, 10th and 11th.

The Moon - the 1st, 3rd. 6th, 7th, 10th and 11th.

Mars - 3rd, 6th and 11th.

Mercury- 2nd. 4th, 6th, 8th, 10th and llth.

Jupiter - 2nd, 5th, 7th. 9th and 11th.

Venus - 1st, 2nd. 3rd. 4th, 5th, 8th, 9th, 11th and 12th.

Saturn - 3rd, 6th and llth.

Rahu - 3rd. 6th. 10th and 11th.

Katu - 3rd. 6th, 10th and 11th.

3. In the course of his transit the Sun is auspicious in 11th, 3rd, 10th and 6th 

if  at  that  the  corresponding  Vedha  place  namely  the  5th,  9th,  4th  and  12th 

respectively are not affected by the transit of any of the planets except Saturn.

4. The auspicious house for the Moon while in transit are the 1st, 3rd, 6th, 

7th, 10th and 11th. The Vedha houses respectively are the 5th, 9th, 12th, 2nd, 4th 

and 8th. In this case the effect will not be marked if Mercury should transit at that 

time the corresponding Vedha place.

5. The auspicious houses for Mars while in transit are the 3rd, 6th and 11th, 

and the corresponding Vedha houses are respectively the 12th, 9th and 5th. The 

same applies to Saturn, but in this case the effect will not be marred if the Sun 

should transit at the time of corresponding Vedha places.

6. The auspicious houses for Mercury while in transit are the 2nd, 4th, 6th, 

246



8th, 10th and 11th. The corresponding Vedha houses are respectively the 5th, 3rd, 

9th, 8th and 12th. In the case of Mercury the effect will not be marred if the Moon 

should transit at the time the corresponding Vedha places.

7. During his transit in the 2nd, 11th, 9th, 5th and 7th Jupiter is good if the 

corresponding  Vedha  places  viz.,  the  12th,  8th,  10th,  4th  and  3rd  are  without 

planets.

8. During his transit in the 2nd, 3rd, 4th, 5th, 8th, 12th, and 11th, Venus will 

produce auspicious effects if the corresponding Vedha places viz., the 8th, 7th, 1st, 

10th, 9th, 5th, llth, 6th and 3rd respectively are without planets.

9-11.  When  the  Sun  transits  through  the  sign  occupied  by  the  Moon 

(Chandra Lagna) the native will suffer from fatigue and loss of wealth. He will 

become short tempered and will be sick. He will perform journey which will tire 

him. The effects of the Sun's transits through the other houses from the Moon will 

be as follows :-

they will be the same as those of Rahu.

30. Mars and the Sun produce effects (during their transit) when they are in 

the first 10 degrees or first decanate of a sign. Jupiter and Venus are effective in 

middle position of a sign (2nd decanate) while the Moon and Saturn become alive 

when  in  the  last  position.  Mercury  and  Rahu  produce  effects  throughout  their 

passage.

The transit of Nakshatras Saptashalaka

26. Draw seven lines horizontally (from West to East) and over them draw 

seven lines vertically. The 28 extremities or points reckoned from the north-east 

are to be ascribed to the 28 stars  (including Abhijit)  counted from Krittika  (as 

shown in the diagram below :—

251



If the star occupied by the Sun at the time happens to be the Vedha star to 

the natal star, there will be apprehension of danger to life; if the Adhana Nakshatra 

(19th  from  the  Janma  Nakshatra),  there  will  be  fear  and  anxiety;  if  to  the 

Kharmaksha  (10th  from the  Janma Nakshatra).  loss  of  wealth  will  take  place, 

should, however, the Sun in the above position be also associated with a malefic, 

death alone has to be expected.

27. If any one of the three Nakshatras mentioned above be thus afflicted by 

association of other malefics (other than the Sun) then death may occur; if with 

benefics, there will be no danger to life. Every thing should be judged in the same 

manner.

28. If the 19th, 10th, 3rd, 1st, 23rd, 5th or 7th (all reckoned from the Janma 

Nakshatra) are afflicted by malefics during their transit, there will be danger to life. 

If the planet be benefic, failure in undertaking will be the only result.

Notes — For Adhana, Karmaksha, Vainisika etc. see Jataka Parijata (p. 625) 

published by Ranjan Publishers.

29. If  the three Nakshatras viz,  the 1st,  the 10th and the 19th happen to 

coincide with the Sun's entry into a new sign,  or  with the transit  of  any other 

planets from one sign to another, or with an eclipse, planetary war, or a fall of 

meteors or any other unexpected occurence, there will be likelihood of death of the 

native or he will face some similar disaster.

252



30. The planets fail to assert their full effects in the course of their transit in 

the following circumstances :—

(a)  If  a  planet  yielding adverse effects  is  aspected by a benefic,  his  evil 

effects are cancelled.

(b) A benefic planet is deprived of his benefical effects if he is aspected by a 

malefic.

(c) A planet loses his capability to do good If he is aspected by an Inimical 

planet or planets.

31. If a planet in the course of his transit Is placed in an evil house identical 

with his own or exalted sign, does not yield adverse effects. If he be placed in an 

auspicious house identical with his own sign or exalted sign, full beneficial results 

may be expected from him.

32. Favourable planets if in the course of their transh are placed in their sign 

of debilitation, or in an inimical or be eclipsed by the Sun's rays lose their power to 

produce good effects. If the planets in the above circumstances get placed in an 

evil house, they yield very adverse effects.

33. If the Sun, Mars, Jupiter and Saturn happen to occupy, in the course of 

their transit, the 1st, 8th or 10th house reckoned from the Moon sign, they cause 

danger to the life of the native, fall from position and loss of wealth.

34. In the course of their transit, the Moon in the 8th, Mars in the 7th, Rahu 

in the 9th, Mercury in the 4th, Jupiter in the 3rd, Venus in the 6th, Saturn in the 1st 

and the Sun in the 5th, from the natal Moon, cause loss of honour and wealth, and 

danger to life.

Planets and Limbs

In  the  following  six  verses,  the  author  describes  how the  27  nakshatras 

reckoned from the Janma Nakshatra (birth star) are distributed among the various 

parts of the body of the native during the course of the transit of each of the planets 

from the Sun onwards. Their effects have also been mentioned.

35. The following table shows the distribution of the 27 nakshatras reckoned

41.  The  planets  who  in  the  course  ot  their  transits  pass  through  signs 

containing more benefic dots (Bindhus) in the Ashtakavarga, always produce good 

effects, even when such signs happen to be the 6th, 8th or 12th. Effects of Latta 

and Sarvatobhadra

42-44. In finding out the transit effects at any particular time-(a) The 12th 

nakshatra from the nakshatra occupied by the Sun,

(b) the 3rd nakshatra from the nakshatra occupied by Mars,

(c) the 6th nakshatra from the nakshatra occupied by Jupiter, and

(d) the 8th nakshatra from that occupied by Saturn, are called lattas.

(a) the 5th nakshatra from that occupied by Venus,

(b) the 7th from that occupied by Mercury,

(c) the 8th from that occupied by Rahu, and

(d) the 22nd from that occupied by the Moon

are  called  Prushtalatta  or  rear  lattas.  If  when  thus  counting  the  Janma 

Nakshatra happens to come as the Latta star, the native will suffer from illness and 

255



mental anxiety.

45-46. During the Sun's Latta there will be financial loss in every venture. 

There will be grief and unhappiness during the Latta of Rahu. There will be death 

of the native, destruction of kinsmen and fear during the Latta of Jupiter. Quarrels 

will take place during the Latta of Venus. Loss of position may be expected during 

the Latta  of Mercury. The native will  suffer excessive financial  loss during the 

Latta of the Moon.

47.  When  two  or  more  Lattas  synchromise,  the  total  effects  will 

proportionately increase in intensity being twice or thrice. Only evil effects may be 

expected as the outcome of such combination.

48. The Vedhas pronounced as auspicious in the Sarvatobhadra Chakra bring 

happiness while those declared as evil produce only misery. This should also be 

taken into account while essessing the, transit effects of a planet.

Notes— Mantreshwara makes of the Lattas and Sarvatobhadra Chakra as 

both having a bearing on the Vedhas.

The Lattas are of two kinds

(1) Forward or puro Lattas and (2) Rear or Prishta Lattas. The Lattas of the 

Sun, Mars, Jupiter and Saturn belong to the former clan. The rest belong to the 

latter.

Thus, if the Sun should occupy at any time, say the nakshatra Moola, his 

Latta nakshatra (which is the 12th from Moola) will be krittika. Suppose at that 

time Venus occupies Sravana, his Latta nakshatra which is the 5th from Sravana 

will be Jyestha, the counting in this case being made from Sravana in the reverse 

order as Venus is a Prishta Latta.

Sarvatobhadra Chakra

Shri V. Subrahmania Sastri in his English translation of Phaladeepika has 

given extracts from Horaratna on Sarvatobhadra Chakra which we take the liberty 

of reproducing for the benefit of the readers.

"Draw ten lines verticalry and other ten lines cross wise over the same. You 

will have 81 squares. Which in regular order the 16 vowels from onwards in the 

256



corner squares commencing from the outer most corner in the North-East,  thus 

filling up in rotation the 4 corners of each of the 4 sets of squares. Fill up the 28 

vacant squares of the outermost comer beginning from the North-East by the 28 

asterism with krittika, so that each side will contain 7 asterism.

The 5 vacant squares of each side of the next row may be filled by a, ba, ka, 

ha, da in the East, by ma, da, pa, ra, ta in the South, na, ya, ma, ja, kha in the West 

and na, sa, ta, ca, la in the North. There now remain 12 squares, 3 on each side in 

the next Inner row. These may be allotted to the 12 signs beginning with Vrishabha 

in the East in regular order.

The 5 inner squares still remaining Vacant may be allotted to the 5 groups of 

Tithy * Nanda, Bhadra, Jaya, Rikta and Purna as shown in the chakra.

The seven week days may be entered in the squares thus :  Tuesday and 

Sunday in the square containing the Nanda group, Wednesday and Monday in the 

Bhadra group; Thursday in the Jaya group; Friday in the Rikta and Saturday in the 

Purna.

Saturn, the Sun, Rahu, Ketu and Mars are malefics. The rest are benefic. 

Mercury is malefic wher associated with malefics, so also is the waning Moon.

In whichever aslant a planet may be posited, three Vedhas arise from the 

same by its aspect - one in the left, one in the first and on in the right.

In the two sides whether in the right or left, the Vedha may be with a star, a 

consonant, a Rasi or Vowel and not with others. For, it has been clearly stated in 

the Rajavijaya thus :

A planet posited in Krittika may have Vedha with the following viz.,  (1) 

Bharani,  (2)  the Vowel (3)  Vrishabna,  (4)  Nanda,  (5)  Bhadra.  (6)  Tula,  (7)  the 

consonant (8) Visakha and Sravana.

Similarly a planet in Rohini will have Vedha with (1) the Vowel (2) Aswini, 

(3) the consonant (4)  Mithuna,  (5)  the Vowel (6) Kanya,  (7)  the consonant (8) 

257



Swati and Abhijit.

In the same way a planet quartered in Mrigasira may have Vedha with (1) 

Kataka (2) the consonant (3) Simha, (4) the consonant (5) Chittra, (6) Revati, (7) 

the consonant (8) the Vowel (...) and (9) Uttarashada.

When a planet is retrograde in motion, the aspect is towards the right. It is 

on the left when the motion is direct (swift). When it is mean one, it is towards the 

front. This is with reierence to the five planets from Mars onwards.

In the case of Rahu and Ketu which are always retrograde the Vedha will be 

on the right and in the case of the Sun and the Moon which move direct and have 

no retrograde motion, the Vedha will be on the left.

Owing to there being no uniformity in motion among the other planets, three 

kinds of vedhas have been mentioned. Malefics when retrograde will cause intense 

evil if they are in Vedha position, while benefics will do immense good. Malefics 

and benefics which in rapid motion partake of the nature of the planets they are 

associated  with,  when  the  four  asterism  Ardra,  Hasta  Poorvashada  and 

Uttarabhadrapaha which occupy the four central position of the outer most border 

are passed over (transitted) by a planet the following four triplets viz. (1) (...) (2) 

(...) (3) (...) and (4) (...) are respectively hit (have Vedhas).

In the case of the pairs (1) (...) (2) (...) (3) (...) and (4) (...) if one letter of any 

pair be hit (has Vedha), the other'should also be considered as hit. A Saumya Vedha 

is one that is caused by a benefic.

If there be Vedha in one of the pairs if similar vowels, the other vowel of the 

pair should also be considered as hit. The same should be made in the case of the 

Anuswara and Visarga (vowels).

When a planet in transit is in the last or the first quarter of two asterisms 

(forming the juncture) in any four comers of the square, there is Vedha of the four 

vowels,  (...)  and  Purna  tithi  in  regular  order  commencing  with  that  vowel 

intervening at the particular  juncture occupied by the planet,  the effects arising 

from these are: agitation or excitement from the first, fear from the second, loss 

from the third and disease from the fourth and death for the fifth.

258



When the Vedha Is with an asterism, there is confusion, when with a letter, 

loss, with a vowel, sickness, and a very great obstacle when with a Tithi or Rasi.

When there are five Vedhas simultaneously, the individual will not live. A 

single Vedha will engender fear in battle, two vedhas, loss of money, three some 

obstacle and four death.

Just as malefics produce evil and benefics eause good, benefics associated 

with malefics produce only evil effects.

In  the  Sun's  Vedha,  there  is  misunderstanding,  in  that  of  Mars,  loss  of 

wealth;  that  of  Saturn  trouble  through  sickness;  in  those  of  Rahu  and  Ketu, 

obstacles.  In  the  Moon's  there  will  be  mixed  effects,  in  that  of  Venus,  sexual 

enjoyment; in that of Mercury, intelligence; in that of Jupiter, all round good effect. 

When the planet causing Vedha is retrograde,  the effect is two told: it  is thrice 

when he is  in exaltation;  when the motion is  rapid (direct),  the usual (natural) 

effect; and when in depression, the effect is only half. Any Tithi, Rasi or Amsa or 

Nakshatra  hit  by  a  malefic  should  be  scrupulously  avoided  in  all  auspicious 

undertakings; a marriage celebrated during a Vedha will not be happy; and any 

journey undertaken will not prove prosperous; any treatment given to a patient will 

not end in cure; and any business started will not be successful. If a Vedha caused 

by a malefic should occur during the time of sickness, it will culminate in death if 

the motion be retrograde. If the motion be direct, the sickness will soon subside. If 

there be Vedha caused by a malefic in one's own week day (of birth), the person 

will not have peace of mind and he will suffer from mental pain.

During the transit  of  the  Sun in the  three Rasis  Vrishabha,  Mithuna and 

Kataka  in  the  East  (see  chakra)  the  direction  is  considered  as  set  while  the 

remaining three as existing (or visible).

The vowels (...) in the North-feast should be considered as belonging to the 

East, the Vowels (...) in the South-East; to the South (...) to the West, (...) to the 

North.

In the particular direction in which the Sun is staying for three months, all 

the asterism, Vowels, Rasis and Tithis in that direction should be deemed as set.

259



When an asterism is set and there is Vedha, sickness will be the result. When 

a consonant is set, there is loss; when a Vowel is set, there is sorrow; when a Rasi 

is set, there is obstacle; when a Tithi is set and there is Vedha, fear will arise. When 

all the five are in the set direction and there is Vedha, death will surely result.

Towards the direction deemed as set journey, fight, discussion, fixing of a 

new door or gate for a place and upper storeys should not be undertaken. Any other 

similar auspicious action should not be done. Whoever has his initial letter situated 

in the set direction should consider himself as destined unfortunate for the time.

People  whose initial  letters  are  in  the  set  direction  should  if  they  desire 

success, show a poetical contest, a fort, a battle (consisting of elephants, horses, 

chariots, infantry, etc.), in that particular quarter.

In the case of an asterism situated in any of the other 'risen' direction, if there 

should be a Vedha, there will be growth. If the Vedha be with a consonant, gain 

will be the result; if with a Vowel, there will be happiness; if with a Rasi, there will 

be success; if with a Tithi, there is lustre; if with all, a position is secured.

When there are Vedhas caused by malefics on both the right and left sides 

with  consonants,  Tithis,  Vowels,  Rasis  and  asterisms  at  any  time,  the  person 

concerned will surely meet with his death.

When at the time of a malefic Vedha, there is a fateful upagraha (see next 

three slokas of this  note)  synchromising,  death is  sure to happen to him either 

through sickness or at battle.

The  fifth  star  reckoned  from  the  one  occupied  by  the  Sun  is  termed 

Vidyumukha. The 8th is called Sula and the 14th Sannipata; the 18th is known as 

Ketu and 21st is Ulka; the 23rd is known as Vajraka and 24th is termed Nirghata. 

These eight are known as Upagrahas and are recorgnised as causing obstacles to all 

undertakings when at the time planets transit their respective palces.

Ascertain  if  there  is  Vedha  with  any  of  the  following  asterisms;  (1) 

Janmabha, (2) Karma, (3) Adhana, (4) Vinasa, (5) Samudayika, (6) Sanghatika, (7) 

Jati (8) Desa and (9) Abhisheka and predict good or bad effects according as the 

Vedha producer by a benefic or a malefic as the case may be.

260



The star in which the Moon is at the time of birth of a person is known as 

Janmabha or Janmarksha. The 10th therefrom is called karmabha or karmarksha. 

The 19th is designed as Adhana, the 23rd is termed Vinasana or Vainsasika, the 

18th star is styled Samudayika, the 16th asterism is known as Sanghatika, the 26th, 

27th and 28th are known as Jati, Desa and Abhisheka respectively.

If the Janmarksha, the karmarksha and the Vinasarksha be each occupied by 

malefic planets,  death,  sorrow, absence from one's place and quarrel  with one's 

relations will respectively resuk.

When  there  is  gala  in  the  Samudayika  Nakshatra,  evil  or  something 

untoward  will  arise.  There  will  be  loss  when  the  Vedha  is  in  the  Sanghatika 

Nakshatra. Destruction of the family will be the effect when the Vedha is in Jati or 

the 26th star from Janmarksha. In the 28th star, the Vedha will cause imprisonment.

When the occultation is by a malefic in the asterism known as Desa, the 

person concerned will be expelled from his country. But Vedha in the above case 

be by benefics, the result will be auspicious. Should the Vedhas with the Upagrahas 

(see supra) also occur simultaneously, the result will be death and nothing short of 

that.

When at the time of a battle, caused by one, two, three, four or five malefics, 

the  corresponding  effects  will  be  fear,  failure,  killing  (bloodshed)  death  and 

ignominy respectively.

When the  Moon happens  to  be  in  Vedha  simultaneously  with  a  Tithi  or 

Nakshatra,  a  Vowel,  a  Rasl  and  consonant  on  any  day,  that  day  will  prove 

auspicious or otherwise according as the planet causing the Vedha is benefic or 

malefic.

While the use of the Sarvatobhadra Chakra and the light it may throw on the 

human cycle of life on the person concerned has fully been explained previously, 

the technique and the pointers to such deductions (of results) have not had full 

explanation to make the same handy and useful for easy reference. The same has 

been explained below.

261



There are 1-2 letters (or sounds) belonging to the 28 asterisms at the rate of 

one  letter  for  each  Nakshatra  Pada.  These  are  mentioned  for  ready  reference. 

Person whose name begins with any one of these letters have got a bearing on the 

corresponding Nakshatra pada and judged accordingly.

49.  If  planets  are  adversely  posited  whether  during  their  transit,  Dasa, 

Antardasa or Ashtakavarga, it will be necessary to propitiate them by performing 

virtuous deeds, observing fasts, prayersprescribed for them, Japa, Shanti, making 

gifts and doing appropriate adorations.

50. The planets are favourable to those who do not commit acts harmful or 

injurious to others, who exercises self control and always follow the path and rules 

of  conduct  laid  down  by  Shastras  and  who  are  always  observing  religions 

discipline.

Chapter 27

Yogas leading to ascetism

1. When  the  lord  of  the  10th  house  in  association  with  four  planets  be 

posited in a kendra or trikona, the native attains emancipation.

He will also attain emancipation if at the time of his birth, the end of a sign 

be rising and the same by owned by a benefic and Jupiter occupies a kendra or 

trikona.

2. If at the time of birth of a person, four or more planets are posited in a 

single house,  he will  become an ascetic of the order indicated by the strongest 

amongst the planets. Some of the learneds are of the opinion that if the lord of the 

10th  house  be  one  amongst  those  plaets,  the  person  will  take  to  the  order  of 

ascetics signified by the lord of the 10th house.

Notes  —  According  to  Brihat  Jataka  if  at  birth  four  or  more  planets 

possessed of strength occupy a single house, the person born will become a Sakya, 

a Jeevika, a Bhikshu, a Vriddha or Guru, a Charakha, a Nigrantha or Vivasa, a 

Vanyasana or vanaprastha, according as Mars, Mercury, Jupiter, the Moon, Venus, 

Saturn, or the Sun, is the strongest planet of the group. If the strongest planet in 

question be conquered in planetary war by another planet or planets at the time of 

birth, the person will relinquish that stage of ascetic life and revert to the previous 

condition in life.

According to Jataka Parijata, Vanaprastha is a religious man engaged in the 

practice of regorous and devout penance. A Vivasa is a naked ascetic dwelling in 

hills  and forests.  A Bhikshu is  an  illustrious  ascetic  with  a  single  staff  for  his 

symbol engaged ever and anon in the contemplation of the truths of the sacred 

scriptures. A Charaka is a religious mendicant wandering over many countries. A 

Sakya  is  an  ill-behaved  ascetic  of  the  Buddhist  class.  A Guru  is  a  celebrated 

teacher endowed with royal splendour. A Jeevaka is a garrulous and gluttonous 

mendicant.

3.  If  the  Moon be posited in  the  decanate  of  Saturn and be aspected by 

263



Saturn  and  Mars,  the  native  will  turn  into  an  ascetic.  If  the  Moon  be  in  the 

Navamsa of Mars and be receiving the aspect of Saturn the person will take to the 

order of ascetism signified by Mars.

4. If the lord of the sign occupied by the Moon at birth, be aspected only by 

Saturn, the native will become an ascetic of the particular class indicated by the 

Janmadeepa. The remarks made above apply here too.

5. The Sun will make the native a chief or lord amongst contemplative saints 

or one who has taken to ascetism. The Moon will make the native an ascetic who is 

travelling to various places of pilgrimge. Mars will cause the native to become an 

ascetic  of  the  Buddhist  order  and  an  expert  in  base  spells.  The  influence  of 

Mercury will enable the native to become a medicant with no knowledge of the 

various schools of philosophy. Jupiter will cause the native to become an ascetic of 

high class possessing knowledge of Vedanta philosophy. Venus will cause to make 

an ascetic who is a hypocrite, outcaste and public dancer. Saturn will produce an 

ascetic who is an outcaste or a heretic.

6-7. The Moon is very strong in the Shukla Paksha or bright half  of the 

month.  But if  the Moon be weak (waning) and be aspected by the lord of  the 

Lagna, the native will become a miserable, distressed and wretched ascetic devoid 

of wealth and company and one who will get his meals with difficulty.

If,  however,  in  the  above yoga,  there  may  exist  a  Rajayoga,  all  the  bad 

effects will be removed and the native will become a lord of earth initiated into 

ascetism and inclined virtuously, receiving respect and reverence from other kings.

8. If four planets including the lord of the 10th be posited in a kendra or 

trlkona or three planets be quartered in an auspicious house, the native will seek 

admission to the holy order and will become a successful ascetic.

If there be more benefic in amongst the planets mentioned above occupying 

auspicious houses, the holy order will be one reverred by the great. If it be not so, 

the holy order will not command reverence.

Thus ends the twenty seventh chapter on "Ascetic Yogas' in Phaladeepika  

composed by Mantreswara.

Chapter 28

Concluding Chapter

1-4. In these verses the author enumerates the number of chapters and the 

subjects dealt with In them. This information has been given in full detail in the 

Table of Contents.

5-6.  In  these  verses  the  author  pays  obeisance  to  Goddess  Sukun  who 

bestows on her  devotees all  that  they desire.  He says  that  he has been able to 

complete  this  work  by  her  grace.  It  has  also  been  mentioned  that  Shri 

Mantreshwara an astrologer and a Brahmin was born in Tirunveli - a district in the 

south  of  present  Tamil  Nadu  State  for  the  enjoyment  and  benefit  of  other 

astrologers.

Thus ends the twenty eighths chapter on "Upasamhara" in Phaladeepika  

composed by Mantreswara.
