Introduction
Uttara Kalamrtta is an important landmark in the
history of Indian Astrology. The text was first printed in the
Telugu script and it was attributed to Kalidasa. But he is
not the celebrated author of Raghu Vansa. Kumara
Sambhaua, Shakuntalam and other works. The reference to
Andhra Bhasha (5.36), Urdu or Persian (5.53), Turushka
(5.49). Sukkani (8.31), Rahu Kala (Second Kanda 29) and
other things show that he came after the sixteenth century.
His use of the words Udyoga (6.42) for job. mud-cleaning
(Second Kanda 67-68), Smarta (second Kanda 35). Nadi
and Vinadi, Sarasa-sallapaIa peculiar Telugu expression.
5.43), Tyajya Kala (8.8) and others prove that he is a South
Indian. His opposition to the marriage with the daughter of
the maternal uncle (Second Kanda, 10-11). references to
the usages in the South (12 in the Second) and the like
prove that he belonged to the borders ofAndhra, Karnataka
and Tamil Nadu.

The Ratha Saptami day should have the Constellation
Anuradha (Kanda 2.44) shows his bad acquaintance with
astronomy. His views on the direction of the well (8.33),
upanayana and other things contradict the earlier
Kalamrita.
The third Chapter is a little unacceptable as it violates
many accepted principles. There are many selfcontradictory ideas. These views have been examined in
our notes. At places the author appears to reject the
authority of Manu and Apastamba. Some of the problems
covered in the earlier Kalamrita appear in this work.
Evidently this author did not write that Kalamrita. These
and other factors convince us that the author belongs to a
time after the 16th or the 17th century.

(v)

There is a Shankara Vijaya attributed to Madhava
Vidyaranya. But the tcxt clearly states that the author was
condensing the work of Vyasachala ( 17th century) and that
he was called Abhinava Kalidasa. fO~Sibly the author of
Uttarakalamrita is the' same one or a person like him.
All this. however. does not belittle the value of the
present work. Some of the salient features may be noted:
(1) He gives a method of finding the past. present and
future births. This is different from the one given by
Varahamihira and others.

(2) There are special kinds of Raja Yogas and their
bhanga (destruction). Particular mcntion is to be made of
Viparita Raja Yoga.
(3) The annual solar return chart is interpreted and
examined in a manner that differs from the Tajika mcthod.
This is very original. It is simple and interesting.
(4) There is an elaborate account of Rahu and Ketu.
(5) The way of interprcting retrograde planets in their
exaltation and debilitation is of much interest.
(6) The mutual periods of Shani and Shukra. Guru
and Shukra and the like are of much value.
(7) Muhurta and nimitta discussed in the eighth
chapter is worth studying.
(8) The first part of the second kanda deals with
religious and other rites. This part we have separated into
one chapter.
(9) Guru and Shani are taken as co-workers. Owning
the last four signs these are the philosophical planets.
Though they rule happiness and misery. they must have a
benefic mutual relation.
(10) Jaimini's system of astrology is simplified.

(11) Horary astrology and the way of treating thc lost
or unknown dates of birth are explained. These arc rrot
simple copyings from earlier works.

lUi)

I

In short. Uttara Kalamrita is a good compendium, a
standard text based on experience. and a treasure house.
We have given 116 charts totllustrate.
The author is a South Indian. and a devotee of the
great Mother Goddess. Para Shaktl, Maha Tripura Sundart.
He belongs to late 17th or early 18th centwy.
Mis Ranjan Publications deserve our praise for
bringtng out this text into English. The illustrative
examples gwen by us are only indications intended to
stimulate further research. The present translator and
commentator is deeply indebted to MI s Ranjan
Publications.

I bow to the Goddess Mahakali who is in the auspicious left part of Kamesa (Shiva). She fulfils all the desires
of her devotees. In her hands are the conch and the wheel
(chakra). The other two hands show the symbols of protection and granting of boons. She is seated on a lion. Her
beauty shines because of the crescent moon on the head of
Shiva. She is resplendant with three eyes. She is interested
in the protection of Vikrama Surya.

Notes
This verse makes it clear that the author is a follower
of the Shakta cult. In this cult Shiva is Kamesvara and the
Goddess is Kamesvari. Here she is called Mahakali. Ujjain
has Mahakalanatha and also Mahakali. The three eyes are
symbolically represented as the Sun, Moon and fire. The
king is again called Vikrama Surya. The author wants us to
believe that he was the celebrated poet.

In the first volume (Purva Kalamrita) everything has
been elaborately expressed regarding definitions and the
like. All these can be known from that volume. In this
volume (Uttara Kalamrita) I will explain clearly and in detail
for the delight of the wise the method of horoscopy[Casting
and interpreting a horoscope. Then I will explain the horary
part of astrology. These reveal the results in the past,
present and future in the metre called Shardula. This
treatment in this Uttara Kalamrita given in detail brings

wealth and also people under one's control.

Notes
Puma Kaiamrlta has seven sections. It deals With
fixing up muhurtas for various activities including the
construction of houses and the digging of wells.
Shardula or Shardula Vikridita is one of the metres
employed by Sanskrit poets. The ganas (unit of three
letters) are represented by letters as ma, sa, ja, sa, ta, ta
.and a guru at the end. The hiatus or caesura is after the
twelfth letter.

With the help of Sanku and other instruments first
observe the Shadow at the time of birth. Determine the
nadis and vinadis that have elapsed from sunrise to the
moment of birth. Then note the duration of the day and of
the night op the day of birth. Take the position of the Sun
in the tropical Zodiac (Sayana) on the day of birth. From
this position calculate the position upto the nadis and
vtnadis that elapsed at the time of birth. Next ascertain the
exact positions of the various planets on the basis of drtgganita and place them in the various signs. Then calculate
the bhavas (houses, not signs) and their junction points. All
this can be obtained by the kindness and blessings of the
teacher. The intelligent one has to determine all these with
a delightful and clear mind.

Notes
The tropical (sayana) position of the Sun is needed to
determine the lagna and the cusp of the tenth house.
Having obtained these, deduct the ayanamsa from these.
The distance from the tenth house to the lagna is to be
divided by three. Add this to the tenth to get the eleventh
house. Add the same to the eleventh and we get the twelfth.
Sixty degrees from the twelfth is the second house. One

20

Uttara Kalamrita

hundred twenty degrees from the eleventh gives the third.
From each of these houses, the opposite ones are 180
degrees away.
Before we illustrate this, a few observations are required. In the absence of watches and clocks, the ancients
measured the time by the shadow of the Sanku in day time,
and by the position of the star at midheaven in the night.
This is no longer needed now because time-pieces are
available; only the difference between the standard time
and the local time has to be applied to the time ofbirth. This
depends on the longitude of the place of birth.
Next he speaks of Drtg-gantta, This is the observed
position of the planets. Any modem ephemeris offers this.
Only differences exist in the ayanamsa (precession of the
equinoxes) followed. For all practical purposes, we may
take the value as given by the Calendar Reform Committee.
Then the author refers to Nadis. This is a term popular
in South India. particularly in Tamil Nadu and Kerala. The
author evidently belongs to the South. Nadiis ghatlka, and
vtnadi is vighattka. The day has sixty ghatikas. Each
. ghatika has 24 minutes; the Vtghatlka is equal to 24
seconds.
The distance between one bhava and the next is to be
halved. This added to the longitude of the concerned bhava
gives the point indicating where that Bhava ends.
For calculating the longitudes of lagna and the tenth
house. it is better to follow the tables of houses. The best
one is Raphael's Tables oj Houses which give the sayana or
tropical longitude. Deducting the ayanamsa from these we
get the nirayana positions.
A lady was born on December 5, 1932 at one Ghatika
and 51 Vtghatikas after sun rise at 13°,41'N, and 80°.0'E.
Sun Rise was at local time 6.13.6.
The Ohattkas and Vlghattkas multiplied by two and
divided by five give the local time of birth as 6.57.30 A.M.
The difference from the standard time shows 7.07.30 A.M.
(1ST). Calculate the Sidereal time of birth on this basis since
the tables of houses give the longitudes of lagna and the

Determincttlon of the time of Birth

21

tenth. Here the sidereal time comes to 11°.52'.5". The ayanamsa as per Lahirl's value is 72°.55'.22".
Raphael's Tables of Houses gives the troptcal Iongttudes. We take only the degrees of the tenth and the first
house. At 13° North we have the following:
Tenth House
Lagna
Virgo
Sagittarius
Std. Time
11.52.40
28°
23°.5'
11.49.0
27°
22°.15'
At 14° North we have 11.52.40
28°
11.49.0
27°
At 13°.41', the birth place, we have 11.52.40
28°
22°.47'.55"
11.49.0
27°
21°.58'.36"
By applying the rule of three for the required Sidereal
ttme,the tropical Lagna is Sagittarius 22°.40'.3" and the
Sidereal Lagna (Nirayana) is Vrischika 29°.44'.42". Similarly the tenth house cusp's tropical Virgo 27°.50'.26" or
Nira1aJ¥l Kanya 4°.55'.5".
The! distance from the tenth house to the lagna is
84°.49'.37". One third of this is 28°.16'.33". Adding this to
the tenth we get the eleventh is Tula 3°.11'.37". Adding the
same to this we have the twelfth in Vrischika 1°.28'.9". Half
of 28°. 16'.33". is 14°.8'.17". Adding this to the tenth we get
the junction of the bhava at 19°.3'.22" of Virgo. Similarly the
eleventh ends at 17°.19'.54" of Tula. The twelfth ends at
Vrischika t5°.36'.25". Deducting this half from thirty
degree we get 15°.51'.43". Add this to the longitudes of
the first. second and third houses to get their junction
points. The planets at or near these points are said to be
weak.
The present editor has serious doubts about the whole
method. The longitude of the tenth house is said to be its
central point. The longitude of the ascendant. however, is
representing the moment of birth. and hence its starting

22

point.

Note the Ghatikas and Vtghatikas that have elapsed
from sunrise to the moment of birth. Multiply them by four
and divide the total by nine. The remainder counted from
Asvini, Magha or Mula indicates the constellation at the
time of birth.
Another method is given. Convert the Ghatikas and
Vighatfkas at the time of birth into Vighattkas. Divide this
by 225. Take the remainder. We get parts - 1 to IS, 16 to
45, 16 to 90, 19 to 150 and 151 to 225. Note in which part
the remainder falls.

The above five groups indicate respectively male, female, male, female, and male births.
Moreover, determine the portion of Mandi in Rasi and
Navamsa, and also of the Moon. The lagna at birth is the
sign occupied by the Moon or Mandl. Or it can be the
seventh, first, fifth, or ninth from either of the two signs
mentioned above. Of the navamsa signs occupied by the
Moon and Mandi find out which has greater strength than
the Rasis occupied by them in the main chart. The lagna
will be one of the houses counted from the stronger navamsa sign of the Moon or Mandl.
Notes

In the example given above the birth ghatikas are one
and Vighatikas 51. Multiply this by four we get 7.24. Dividing this by nine, we get the remainder 7.24. The constella-

Determination oj the time oj Birth

23

tion at birth should be the eighth one from Asvini. It comes
to Pushyami, Anuradha or Uttarabhadra. It is one star
behind. The intention of the author is to convert the time
into Vighatikas. Thus we get Ill. Multiplied by four it is
444 and dividing it by nine. the remainder is three.
Another way of counting is from Dhanrshtha,
Mrtgastra or Chitrao Then this agrees with the birth
constellation which is Purvabhadra. Either method can be
applied.
The division by 225 has not worked in a large number
of cases. It can safely be ignored.
Multiply the vighatikas of birth by three and divide it
by seven. The remainder counted from Sunday or Friday,
should give the weakday of birth. In our example III x 3 =
333. Dividing it by seven, the remainder is four. Counting
from Friday we get Monday which is the correct day of birth.
Readers may consult Bh, Satyanarayana's Nadi
Rectification. Only in a few cases his tables have proved
correct.
Sign occupied by the Moon or Mandi in Rashi or
Navamsa; 1, 5, 7 or 9 from these two in Rasi or Amsa-these
are many alternatives intended to justify the lagna somehow. or to adjust it.
Mantresvara's view is different and simpler. (3.16)
Find the Rasi occupied by Mandi at the time of birth and
also where the lord of the sign is situated. The lagna at birth
is 1.5.9 from that lord, or 1.5,9 from the navamsa having
Gulika. When the Moon is stronger. take these from the
Moon sign. not from Mandl.
There is a lot of confusion about Mandi and Gulika.
Some texts use these two words as synonymous. Mandt's
position is determined thus: When the duration of the day
or night is thirty Ghatis, Mandt's position is at the end of
26. 22. 18, 14, 10, 6 and 2 ghatis after sunrise in the
sequence of the weekdays from Sunday. During the night
the position of Mandl is at the end of 10. 6. 2. 26. 22. 18
and 14 ghatis from sunset in the sequence of the weekdays

24

Uttara Kalamrita

from Sunday.
The position of Gulika is determined thus: Divide the
duration of the day by eight. Count from the lord of the
weekday and Gulika's position is at the end of Saturn's
part. If the birth is on a Thursday, Gulika's position is at the
end of the third part. For the night birth, divide the duration
by eight. From the fifth lord of the weekday, count where
Saturn's portion ends. If one is born in the night of Thursday, the count begins from Monday (Moon).
In our example the birth was on a Monday in the day
time. Sun rise was at 6.13.6 and sunset was at 5.27;27. The
duration of the day was 28 gha~~, and 5.87 vighatikas.
If the duration of the day is 30 ghatikas, Mandt's position
will be at the end of22 ghatikas. By rule of three, on the day
of birth Mandi is at 20 ghatikas and 36;3 vighatikas.
Gulika's position will be at the end of the sixth part which
is 21 ghattkas, 4.4 Vighatikas. Mandl and. Gulika should not
be confused., The author of Uttara-Kalamrita appears to
equate the two.

The duration of the day in Ghatikas and Vighatikas
multiplied by 26,22, 18, 14, 10,6 and 2 (respectively from
Sunday onwards) and divided by 30 shows the exact position of Mandi in ghattkas on the day of birth. It is from
sunrise. The duration ofthe day or night is to-be divided by
eight and counted from the day of birth to Saturday. In the
case of a night birth, the count begins with the fifth day
from the day of birth.

of Mandi has to be in' the order given in the earlier notes.

The eighth part has no lord. Gulika's position comes

The delivery room will be in the eastern part of the
house if the rising sign at birth is Aries, Cancer, Libra,
Scorpio or Aquarius. It will be in the southern part if the
lagna is Simha or Makara. It is in the western part, if the
Iagna be Vrishabha. It will be in the northern part if the
lagna is Mithuna, Kanya, Dhanus or Mina. Note whether

The number of planets between the lagna and the
Moon indicate the number of women attending on the
delivery of the child. The number of women outside the
delivery room are indicated by the number of planets outside this axis. the portion to be covered by the Moon in the
sign at the time of birth indicates the quantity of oil in the
.lamp. The size ofthe wick is to be determined by the portion
of lagna left below the horizon. From the nature of the sign
occupied by the Sun, determine the nature of the lamp. The
wick is flickering, steady or both depending on the Sun
occupying a movable, fixed, or common sign.
Sun, Venus, Mars, Rahu, Saturn, Moon, Mercury and
Jupiter are respectively the lords of east, south-east, south,
south-west, west, north-west, north and north-east.
The planets in Kendras (1, 4, 7, 19) from lagna and
their strength determine the position of the door of the
delivery room. The strongest reveals the direction of the
door.
If there are no planets in the kendras, we have to
depend on the strength of the Kendras. This may be the
intention for the use of the word 'Viryavat'.

All the twelve signs (Rasts) of the Zodiac rise one after
another in the east. The first six signs from lagna form the
right side of the native, while the other six represent the left

those from lagna to the sixth represent the left side of the
partner. 'The lagna is a symbol of life (prana). of the vital
force.vThe sign occupied by the Moon is the body of the

be predicted from these two: lagna and the Moon. The

Mars. Venus. Mercury, Moon. Sun, Mercury. Venus, Mars,
Jupiter, Saturn, Saturn and Jupiter. The vargas or divisions of any chart are to be noted. The first is the grtha or
house or sign. A sign has two horas of equal duration. One

signs these are governed by the lords ofthe first seven Rasis
from that sign; and in even rasis the lords are from the
seventh of that sign. Navamsa is the ninth part of a sign,
each having 3°.20'. For the signs Aries. Leo and Sagittarius
these are counted from Aries; for Taurus, Virgo, and Capricorn, the count is from Capricorn; for Libra, Aquarius and
Gemini, the counting is from Libra; and for Cancer, Scorpio

(0° to 5°), Aquarius (5° to 10°), Sagittarius (l0° to 18°).
Gemini (18° to 25°) and Libra (25° to 30°). In even signs these
fall in Taurus (0° to 5°), Virgo (5° to 12°), Pisces (12° to 20°),

Simha is the mulatrikona of the Sun; Vrishabha for
the Moon, Mesha for Kuja, Kanya for Budha, Dhanus for
Guru, Tula for Shukra and Kumbha for Shani are the
mulatrikonas. Sun in Mesha, Moon in Vrishabha, Kuja in
Makara, Budha in Kanya, Guru in Karkataka, Shukra in
Mina and Shani in Tula are exalted. When a planet is
exalted, he gets full one rupa of strength. In his mulatrikona the planet has three fourths of a rupa as his
strength. In his own house the strength is half a rupa. In
a friend's house it is one-fourth. and in the house of great
friend (adhi mitral it is three-fourths. In an enemy's house
it is one-sixteenth; and in a bitter enemy's (adhi-Shatru)
house it is 1/32. In the house of a neutral it is one-eighth.

When a planet is retrograde, his strength is equal to
that of exaltation. A planet in conjunction with a retrograde
one has the strength of half a Rupa. A planet exalted in the
Rasi while retrograde is similar to a debilitated one and it
has no strength. A retrograde planet in his debilitation has
the strength of exaltation. A planet in conjunction with a
planet in exaltation has the strength of half a Rupa. When
it is conjoined with a planet in debilitation has no strength.
A planet in conjunction with malefics who are his friends.
or with benefics that are his enemies, has a strength of half
a Rupa.

Notes
Rupa is a unit of measurement to calculate the

strength. It is the numeral one. The views regarding retrograde planet in exaltation or in debilitation are found to be
inaccurate in actual experience. Any retrogression gives
strength to the planet and increases its Cheshta Bala.

Cheshta refers to retrogression. The author asks us to
follow the earlier authorities who have elaborately explained this. It involves many astronomical calculations.
These can be had from the texts of Kesava, Sripati and
others.
We'nave to calculate the mean position of the planets
Kuja, Guru and Shanl. The mean longitude of the Sun is
their Seeghrochcha. The mean position of the Sun is taken
for Budha and Shukra also. The Seeghrochcha of Budha
and Shukra (their apogee) has to be Calculated. Add the
mean longitude to the true longitude of a planet and divide
it by two to arrive at its cheshtakendra. This divided by 180
gives the Cheshta Bala of the planet. These calculations are
explained in Srlpati Paddhati and in Dr. B. V. Raman's
Graha and Bhava Balas.

these houses from themselves. All planets aspect fully the
seventh from themselves. No planet aspects the second,
sixth, eleventh and twelfth houses from itself.

Notes
The aspect on the fifth and the ninth is the trine
(120°, 240°) aspect; that on the fourth and the eighth is
a square (90°, 270°) aspect; that on the third is a sextile
(60°) aspect. The last should include the aspect on the
eleventh (300°), though the author denies it. The aspect
on the eighth (210°) is quincunx; and 'this can include
the aspect on the sixth (150°), 'inspite of the author's
denial. The aspect on the seventh is called opposition
(180°) aspect. According to Parasara, Rahu aspects 5, 7,
9 and 12 fully, 2 and 10 by half, and 3 and 6 by a quarter.
Western astrologers speak of semi-square (45°, 315°),
sesquiquadrate (135°), Quintile (72°), Biqutntlle (144°),
Tredecile (108°), Decile (36°), and Vigintile (18°) aspects
also.

Deduct the longitude of the aspecting planet from that
of the aspected planet. The result is the range of the aspect.
By the rule of three we can arrive at the aspect-strength
from these degrees. We may have to add or subtract the
proportionate difference between the strength fixed for that
sign and that fixed for the next one. The resulting drigbala
is malefic or benefic according to the aspecting planet being
malefic or benefic. We have to enter these in terms of Rupas
under two heads. The total will give the exact aspectstrength received by a planet.

Notes
The calculation of drishtibala is not as simple as it

44

Uttara Kalamnta

appears from these lines. It needs much calculation. The
deduction of the longitude of the aspectmg planet from that
of the aspected one gives drishtikendra, aspect mgle. Then'
there are the special aspects of Guru (120 to 150°, and 24<>:
to 270°), Shani (60 0 to 90 0 ,
270° to 300°) and KuJa (90°
to 120°, and 210 to 240 Where these special aspects fall
we have to add .5 to Guru, .75 to Shant and .25 to Kuja.
Malefic aspects are those of the Sun, waning Moon, badly
associated Budha, Kuja and Shant. Benefic aspects are
those of Guru, Shukra, waxing Moon, and isolated or wellassociated Budha.

The natsargtka or natural strength of the Sun is one
Rupa. The natural strength of Chandra is less than this by
a seventh. From each preceedtng.one the succeeding one is
less by a seventh in the sequence of Shukra, Guru, Budha,
Kuja, and Shant. The six sources of strength-8apta Varga,

Dik) Kala, Cheshta, Drishti and Naisatgika have to be
added for each planet, This gives the Shadbala of the planet
concerned.

It is the rectified dngbala that should be taken into
consideration. If a planet is victorious in Oraha Yuddha, it
gets a strength of one Rupa. The vanquished one loses one
Rupa. The total of these six balas (as rectified) is the
planet's Shadbala in Rupas. A planet having less than five
Rupas is weak. It has the normal strength if its strength is
between five and ten Rupas.

The planet having more than ten Rupas will be
fully strong. Such a planet is beneficial. His major period
produces highly favourable results. The native will have in
that period all that he aspires for. His desires will be
fulfilled.

46

Vitam Kalamrita

When a planet is proceeding fro
his debilitation to
his exaltation, and if it has average strength, his period also
will bring happiness. But if the planet is moving towards
his deltbttation, his period is unfavourable.
The period of a planet having less than five Rupas
brings misery and unhappiness.

The author now describes how to calculate Amsa
Ayurdaya. This is to be taken as final when lagna is stronger than the Sun and the Moon.
Count the number of constellations from Asvini that
have elapsed with reference to the position of a planet in the
chart. Dividing this by three. take the remainder and multiply it by four. Add the number of padas covered by the
planet in the constellation. This gives the number of navamsas from the beginning of Mesha. This is the number of
years contributed by that planet in the Amsa Ayurdaya
method. From the quarter (pada) in which the planet is,
calculate the months and days by the rule of three. The
years. months and days contributed by the two luminaries.
five planets. and lagna have to be added.
Notes

Longevity can be calculated in eight possible ways. It
is the strongest among the eight that determines the Iongevtty which is applicable to a given chart. The strongest is
found after calculating the Shadbala of the planets and
Bhava Bala. The author has not touched upon Bhava Bala.
This is arrived at by adding three factors. These ar~ the

48

Uttara Kalamrlta

strength of the lord of the concerned Bhava, the direction
(dik) of that bhava, and the aspect strength on the same.
The various types of longevity that depend on the
strongest factor-this is mentioned within brackets--are
the following:
Amsa (Lagna), Pinda (Sun). Naisargika (Moon). Bhinna
Ashtakavarga (Kuja), Rasmi (Budha), Kakshatra (Guru).
Kala Chakra (Shukra), and Sarmday Ashtaka varga (Shant).
The first three are explained elaborately and with
utmost scientific accuracy in Srtpatt Paddhatt. Nearly
eighty per cent of the charts show that we have to apply
Amsa or Pinda Ayurdaya only. Amsa Ayurdaya is applicable
to a larger number of the charts. Hence the author explains
it.
Note how many navamsas have been traversed by a
planet. Each navamsa constitutes one quarter of a constellation. The example chart will be the basis for our study.
The navamsas have to be counted from the beginning of
Mesha.
The elapsed navamsas
in our example are given
along with the decimal
21.40
showing how many of the
Chlondra
19.24
navamsas are traversed.

Malefics occupying houses 7 to 12, lose a part of the
years they contribute. The loss is full in the 12th, half in the
lIth, 1 /3 in 10th, 1 /4 in 9th, 1 /5 in 8th, and 1/6 in 7th.
Benefics in these houses lose half of what the malefics lose.
That is, from the twelfth onwards they lose 1/2, 1/4, 1/6,
1/8, 1/10 and 1/12.
A malefic occupying lagna removes the years contributed by the Lagna.
A planet in delibitation loses half, a planet in an
enemy's house loses one-third, and a planet in combustion
or defeated in. war loses. one half of its years. This is the
peculiarity of this method..
Notes
There is not only reduction, but also an increase which
1s taken for granted by the author.
(a)
(b)

The years contributed by a planet are trebled when
it is exalted or retrograde.
The years are doubled when it is Vargottama (same
sign in Rasi and Navamsa), when it is in its navamsa
sign or Rasi sign or in its own Drekkana. Only the
maximum multiplication has to be done, not two or
more.

In our example Budha is retrograde and his years have
to be multiplied by three. Shukra and Shani are in their
own houses and Guru is in his own house in Navamsa.
Kuja is Vargottama. Thus the years contributed by Kuja,
Guru, Shukra and Shani have to be doubled. We thus get
. the following figures:

Uttara ·Kalamrita

50

Ravi 8.95, Chandra .5, Kuja 9.93, Budha 25.995, Guru
17.14, Shukra 22.21, and Shani 23.0. The total comes to
107.725 years.
Next comes the reduction known as Chakrapata as
explained by the author. When there are two or more
planets in the same house, only the strongest is subject to
reduction.
The Shadbalas of the example chart show that Budha
is stronger than Ravi, and Guru is stronger than Kuja.
Guru gets into the tenth bhava. Hence the reduction is for
both Kuja and Guru.
Budha as a malefic loses half the years he has contributed. Guru in the tenth bhava loses one-sixth. Thus he
gives 14.283 years. Kuja loses one-fourth and he now gives
7.4475 years. Shukra in the eleventh loses one-fourth. His
contribution now is 16.6575 years.
Let us tabulate thus far:

The next deduction is one-third for occupying an
enemy's house. Here no planet occupies such a house.
Then we have to apply for combustion. It means a planet
with the Sun. The distances from the Sun where combustion begins and ends are in degrees-Chandra 12, Kuja 17,
Budha 14, Guru 11, Shukra 10, and Shani 15, Retrograde
Budha 12, and Retrograde Shukra 8.
Budha is combust and he loses everything.
Finally there is the reduction due to a malefic rising in
lagna. In our example there is Budha.

Determination of Longevity

51

The author's treatment of this reduction is sketchy.
The last arises after all the increases and reductions are
made. Multiply the number of Amsas elapsed in lagna by
the total number of years given by the planets. This is to be
divided by 108. The quotient gives the years to be deducted
from the total.
For a more accurate method of calculating Amsa
Ayurdaya, the best text is Srlpatl Paddhatl.

Find how many ghatikas and vtghatikas have elapsed
in lagna, Multiply this by nine and divide the product by the
total duration of the lagna. This gives the years contributed
by lagna. The remainder has to be converted into months
and days.
The lagna becomes strong when its lord or a benefic is
in it or aspects it, or when its lord is exalted. Then the
number of years contributed by the lagna are to be counted
from Mesha to the lagna. This is the view of some astrologers.
Notes
When a malefic is in the lagna or aspects it,
the deduction is only half of what was arrived at in the
notes of the previous verse. If two or more planets are in
lagna, we have to consider only the one who is nearer to the
lagna.
The years contributed by lagna have to be noted. In
our example only eight navamsas elapsed, and in the second .925 was over. Thus it gives 8.925 years. The aspect of
its lord does not fall on it as there is only a distance of
103°.12'. It is not 120°. Adding 8.925 to the previous total
, we get years 79.828. This is not true, as the Krurodaya

Uttara Kalamrita

52

harana has not been applied. The method explained under
these three verses is too general.

Lagna has three drekkanas. It has one drekkana on
each side. Calculate the Sapta Varga strengths of the lords
of these three drekkanas in terms of Rupas. This represents
the Punya (religious merit) of the native. When this is
deducted from four, it shows the papa (sin or evil) of the
native. If these differ by four or more Rupas, and if the
Rupas of Punya are more, the native achieves final emancipation.

Notes
The previous drekkana refers to the past, the drekkana
of lagna to the present, and the next to the future births.
In our example the next drekkana falls in the next
sign. The author does not tell us what to do in such cases.
We follow the traditional lords of the drekkanas. The three
drekkanas in our example are owned by the Moon, Guru,
and Kuja. The Sapta Varga strengths are-Moon 1.812,
Guru 1.4175, and Kuja 1.6875. Deducting these from four,
we get respectively 2.188, 2.5825, and 2.3125. These are
the malefic portions in Rupas.

After obtaining the benefic and malefic portions of
Sapta Varga strength of the three lords of the drekkanas,
take the malefic portions only. Multiply these by 120 and
divide the product by seven. Expunge multiples of 120. The
result shows the number of years the native lived in the

Determination oj Longevity

53

past birth, lives in the present and will live in the future.
This method is suggested only to open up some dis, cussion. It is simpler than the method of Amsa Ayurdaya.

Notes
This method does not work. It is faulty. For the previous birth of the native, the malefic portion of Chandra is
2.188. This multiplied by 120 and divided by seven given
37.51 years. For the present birth Guru's malefic portion is
2.5825. This gives 44.27 years. The native is alive even after
fifty six years of age.

(a) The native has a long life if Shukra, Guru and
Budha are in kendras and konas. (b) When these are in
houses 2, 3 and 11 the native has a medium life (madhya
ayurdaya, which does not exceed 66 years of age). (e) If
these planets are in houses 6, 8 and 12, the native has a
short life. (d) Planets other than these, the malefics, posited
in 8, 12, kendras 0,4,7, 10) and konas do not give rise to
any benefic results.

Now a oombinatlonfor a short life is given. The lagna
or the moon should be aspected by .he lord of the eighth
house; or the lord of the eighth house from the Moon or
.lagna must be aspected by Shant or Kuja. In both cases no
benefic should aspect the lord of lagna or the lord of the

Determination oj Longevity

59

sign occupied by the lord oflagna. Then even if his longevity
is normally expected to be similar to that of Markandeya,
the native has a very very short life.

Notes
Here are two important combinations:
(a) The lagna lord and the lord of the sign occupied by
the lord of lagna should not have any benefic aspect. The
lord of the eighth house should aspect the lagna or the
Chandra lagna.
(b) The lord of the lagna and of the sign having the
lagna lord should not be aspected by any benefic. The lord
of the eighth from lagna or from the Moon should be
aspected by Shani or Ku]a.
Chart 12 fulfills the second combination. The lagna
lord is aspected only by malefic Kuja. The eighth lord from
the Moon is aspected by
L 11
Ravi 9
Chandra 5
Shant.
But there is the
Budha 21
Shukra 2

benefic aspect of Guru also
on Shukra. The lord of the
eighth from lagna is Kuja
19
who is aspected only by the

though the lord of that sign

In chart 22 the lagna

When there is a mutual relation between the planets
of the following six groups, they bring much fame and make
the person the best ruler or administrator (literally. a king)
and auspicious.
(t) Planets in their exaltation. own houses, friend's
houses. and trikonas (1, 5. 9);
(tt) Planets in Kendras (1, 4. 7, 10) and in Vargottama:
(ttl) Planets aspected by or conjoined with benefice, and
those that are between benefics;
(tv) Planets situated in their mula-trikona houses;
(v) Planets moving towards their exaltation; and
(vt) Those that own both a trikona and a kendra.
./

Notes

The groups are too general. The last combination
applies to Vrishabha, Karka, Simha, Tula, Makara, and
Kumbha lagna natives only. The planets involved are
respectively Shani, Kuja, Kuja, Shant, Shukra and
Shukra.

The fourth combination refers to Mesha (Kuja), Vrishabha (Chandra), Simha (Ravt), Kanya (Budha), Tula
(Shukra), Dhanus (Guru), and, Kumbha (Shani).
Benefics are Guru, Shukra, waxing Moon (from the
eighth day of the bright half of the lunar month to the
eighth day of the dark half), and Budha who is not with any
malefic like Ravi, Kuja, Shani, Rahu, and waning Moon.
In chart 32 Shant and Chandra (lords of kendras), Ravi

The yogas mentioned in the first verse are destroyed by
the following groups of planets:

(vi) Planets in a Bhava-Sandhi;
(vti) Weak planets; and
(viii Planets owning 6, 8, 12 houses but with the lords of
kendras or trikonas.
Notes
When two or more planets are within one degree in the
same sign, the planet that is ahead is said to be victorious.
The planets Budha, Guru and Shant are called Paura. Kuja
and Shukra are named yayt. The war between one Paura
and another Paura is the worst. The war involving two yayis
is mild. The war between one Paura and one Yayi is worse.
A weak planet is one weak in Shadbala having less
than five Rupas of strength. According to Sripati, the minimum strength required in Rupas is-Ravi 6.5, Chandra 6.0,
Kuja 5.00, Budha 7.00, Guru 6.5, Shukra 5.5 and Shani

They should exchange houses (or stars);

But these two lords should not own the eighth or

The ninth is the strongest kona called dharma,

There are three pairs of planets: (l) owners of the ninth
and tenth houses from lagna: (it) owners of the ninth and
the tenth from the ninth house; and (itt) lords of these
houses from the tenth. These three respectively give high.
medium or small position to the native.
These three pairs can have three kinds of relationship
between them: (a) conjunction, (b) interchange, and
(c) mutual aspect.
1. Anyone of these pairs may be mutually related
by any of the three relationships. They should be
strong.
2. Anyone of these pairs may be in mutual kendras.
3. Any pair must have conjunction with the planet
owning the house occupied by the lagna lord.
Anyone of these combinations will make the native
wealthy and he will be a ruler (literally, a king).

Notes

In Einstein's chart (39) the lords of 9 and 10 have
exchanged houses and they are strong. He is the presiding
deity of modern mathematical physics. In Tilak's chart
there is mutual aspect of these lords (40). They are in
mutual kendras. In chart 41 the ninth lord aspects the lord
of the tenth. A similar Kendra position appears in other
charts. Chart 40 also shows Kuja and Guru as lords of 9
and 10 from the ninth. It is a medium yoga. In another chart
the ninth and tenth lords from the tenth are Kuja and Guru
who are in mutual aspect and who are in mutual kendras.
The yoga is small. This may explain his suffering. In a chart
given earlier the lords of 9 and 10 from the ninth are Guru
and Shani who are together in Shukra's house with
Shukra.

A benefic (t) in his own house, (it) in his
exaltation, (ttl) in his friend's house, or (tv) in Vargottama brings happiness to the native. If such a planet
is a malefic one, placed in any of these positions will
give favourable results. The planets owning the Rasi
and Navamsa of the lord of a Bhava, should be strong.
Then the owner of that Bhava will give profitable
results. A powerful benefic in a friendly Rasi and
Amsa of any Bhava will confer the benefic results
of the Bhava.

Notes
It is not clear whether natural' or functional
benefics are intended. For Vrishabha lagna the
natural benefic is a functional malefic. We have

(1) If the Karakas (signtncators) of the Bhavas are
inimical to those Bhavas (houses), and if the owners of the
Rasi and Navamsa having the lord of the bhava are hostile
to the Bhava and its signtfieator, the effects of the concerned Bhava are ruined.

(2) If a malefic is posited in a sign owned by a Karaka
(stgnifieator), it destroys the effect to be given by the signtfieator.
(3) A malefic occupying a sign owned by a stgmflcator
will lessen the effects of that Bhava.

Notes

The stgntfieator of the father is the Sun, and the house
is the ninth. For Vrishabha lagna the ninth is owned by
Shani who is hostile to the Sun. The same applies to
Mithuna, Kanya and Kumbha lagnas as far as the father is
concerned. The fifth house and the Karaka for children are
hostile to Vrishabha, Mithuna, Makara and Kumbha lagnas. The seventh house and the Karaka for partner are
hostile in the case of Mithuna (neutral), Karaka (neutral),
Simha, Kanya (neutral), Vrishabha (neutral), Tula (neutral),
Vrishchika (neutral), Dhanus, Makara, Kumbha, and Mina
lagnas. In this way we have to judge the chart for the other
bhavas as well.

A planet in the second from a Bhava is its Chadaka, in

and in the eighth from it Prati-bandhaka. From the planet
in the the eighth from a bhava one should interpret the
increase or decrease of that Bhava. The owners of til

Bandhaka is one who imprisons. Pratibandhaka is an opposing force. Vedha is an obstructing power.

The aspect by friendly planets on a malefic planet
is called 'Svadhina Vedha'. The aspect cast by unfriendly
malefics on the malefic one is 'Paradhina Vedha'.
The aspect of the benefics gives similar results; and these
are experienced at the beginning, while those of the malefics are a little unfortunate experienced towards the end.
The 'bhagya' or fortune and longevity of the native is similarly determined by the strengths of the benefics and
malefics.

'Svadhina' isthat which is under control and therefore
n o t productive of bad results. The other is beyond control
and hence malefic. The enemies of the malefics are:
Sun - Shani and Shukra; Waning Moon - no one; Kuja
Budha; Budha - Chandra; Shani - Ravi, Chandra and
KUJa.

Actually the term Vedha plays a major role in transit

There are three yogas: (l) The lord of the eighth in the
sixth or twelfth; (ti) The lord of the sixth in the eighth or

These three are Viparita Raja yogas-extra-ordinary
Raja yogas. These lords must be related mutually by conjunction, mutual aspect, or mutual exchange of houses.
They should not at the same time have any such relation
with other planets. Then the native becomes a famous.

When malefics are debilitated, strong benefics are
posited in kendras and konas, and the lords of 4,9 and 10
are together in the ninth or tenth house from the lagna, the
native becomes a ruler, wise or intelligent, highly wealthy,
famous, valorous and longlived. Such a wise one will be
respected by other rulers and is similar to an all-knowing
one.

Houses I, 4, 7 and 10 from lagna are called kendra,
kantaka (literally, thorn), and Chatushtaya (four). The
houses following these are 2, 5, 8 and II, and these are
known as Panapharas. The remaining ones that follow
these are 3, 6, 9 and 12 and these are termed Apoklimas.
Houses 5 and 9 from lagna are the Trikonas. Houses 3, 6,
10 and 11 are known as Upachayas (houses of increase).
The sign where the Moon is posited is the Janma Rasi or
Chandra lagna. The lagna is the first house.
Notes

The term Trikona means a triangle having three
angles. The author has mentioned only the fifth and the
ninth houses. Lagna is the third member of the Trikonas.
Lagna is both a kana and a kendra.

The Sun has the soul or nature of God Rudra, and he
represents the father. The Moon has the soul or character
of Shakti and stands for the mother. The planets KUja-:-J
Budha, Guru, Shukra and Shani have arisen from (born of,
produced by) the five elements which are respectively
Prithvi (earth), Apas (water), Tejas (fire), Vayu (air), and.
Akasha (ether).
Guru, Shukra and Budha are born of (have the nature
of) Sattva Guna. Mars arose out of the Guna called Rajas
(desire, attachment). Shani is born of the Guna Tamas
(appetite, passion).
The Sun and the Moon do not bring about the deatfrJ
of any native. But when they own the malefic houses 6 or
8, they cause much suffering.

Notes
In the Sankhya system of Philosophy and in the
Bhagavad Gita we come across the three gunas, Sattva
refers to the causal body, Rajas to the subtle body, and
Tamas to the gross or physical body with the senses.
Mars stands for the earth, as he is called the son of the
earth in our mythology. Mercury being the son of the watery
Moon, he stands for water. As fire is opposed to water, Kuja
is inimical to Budha. It is to be noted that the watery signs
are ruled by the Moon (Karka), Kuja (Vrishchika) and Guru
(Mina).

Varahamihira gives fire to the Sun, water to the Moon,
fire to Kuja (2.5), Earth to Budha, Ether or Akasha to Guru,
Water to Shukra, and Vayu to Shani (2.6). Further he
ascribes Sattva Guna to the Sun, Moon and Guru; Rajas to
Budha and Shukra, and Tamas to Kuja and Shani (2.7).
According to Yavanesvara, the Sun, Kuja and Guru have
Sattvaguna, Chandra and Shukra have Rajas, Shani has
Tamas, and Budha has the guna of the planet he is associated with. Satyacharya (Satyakirti) observed that Kuja
and Shani have Tamas, Budha and Shukra have Rajas, and
the rest have Sattva. Varahamihira follows Satyacharya.

Uttara Kalamrita

Notes
Srutakirti stated that the ancients spoke of seven
kinds of Adhi yoga. Then the three benefics need not be in
the three houses. They can be in two houses or in one only.
If there is only one planet strongly placed in one of these
houses, the native becomes a leader. If there are two, he
becomes a minister. If there are three. he has an eminent
position in life.

If Guru were J;o be in the sixth or eighth from the Moon,
it will give rise to kemadruma yoga which is undesirable.

Hence Guru should be in the seventh for a proper Adhi
yoga.
In Shivaji's chart (Simha lagna already given), the
Moon is in kanya with Ravi and Guru in Kumbha, Budha
in Mina, and Shukra in Mesha. This is more or less a perfect
adhi yoga. the great scholar, philosopher and Saint Appaya
Dikshita (Kanya lagna) had his Moon ip Mina while
Ravi and Budha are in Kanya and Shukra in Tula. The
two benefics are in their own houses, and Budha is
aspected by the Moon and by Guru from Makara. This is a
perfect yoga.

The units of brilliance for the seven planets (in
the order of the week days) are 30, 16, 6, 8, 10, 12 and
1. Take the Kalas of the lord of the ninth from Iagna and
of the lord of the ninth from the Moon. Add them. Divide
it by twelve and take the remainder. Count the remainder from the Moon sign. This is Indu lagna, If there is
a benefic without any malefic, the native becomes a
multi-millionaire. If there is a malefic, his wealth is
in thousands only. If the malefic is exalted, he will be
multi millionaire.

To measure the financial assets this Indu lagna is
considered by some astrologers.

A fixed sign is stronger than a cardinal or movable one.
The dual or common sign is stronger than the fixed one.
When there are three planets in three houses, the two
aspects of two planets over the third depends on their being
a Chadaka or Vedhaka. The power of the aspect increases
in relation to the aspecttng planet being in a movable, fixed,
or dual sign. The same principle applies to the effects of the
planets from these three signs and houses.
When three planets are in the first drekkana of a
movable sign, in the second drekkana of a fixed one, and in
the third drekkana of a dual sign. the effects are full. The
effect is average if they are in the second decanate of a
movable one, the last one in a fixed sign and the first in a
dual sign. The effects are little when the planets are in the
last decanate of a movable sign, in the first of a fixed sign
and the second of a dual sign.

The planets may cause a good or bad yoga when they
are Within an orb of twelve degrees. Of these two, if the
planet that has a slower average motion is in advance and
the one that has a faster average motion is behind, the yoga
yields results. The effects are fully realised when they are

Uttara Kalamrita

within one degree, and they are absent when they are
separated by twelve degrees. In the intermediate positions
we have to determine the strength of the yoga proportionately.
If the faster planet is in advance by twelve or more
degrees, the good effects of the yoga are spoilt till that
period.

When a strong Moon has an applying aspect on one of
the two planets causing the yoga (given in verse 32), within
the limits of the orb, the results will be specially Significant.
If the aspecting Moon is posited in 6, 8 or 12, the results
will not be marked ones. Planets aspect all houses. The
aspect gives the best results if the aspecting planet is
exalted or is in his own house. The results are average when
the aspecting one is in a friend's house.

Effects of the Planets and Houses

103

Notes

When the aspectmg planet's degrees are less than
those of the aspected one, it is an applying aspect. When
the aspecting planet's degrees are more, it is a separating
aspect.
Earlier in verses 2. 18 and 19 the author states that
no planet aspects 2, 6, 11 and 12 from itself. Here he
observes that planets aspect all houses. The aspects on 2
and 12 are called Parallel, on the third it is sextile (60°) or
semi square (45°) and on the sixth it is quincunx (150°).
This is the view of Western astrologers. In calculating
drishti bala (aspect strength), we take into consideration
only the distance from 30° to 300° between the aspectmg
and the aspected.

Note the sign where the lord of a Bhava is posited.
Count from that Bhava to the sign having its lord. The same
number of signs counted from that lord gives the Pada or
Arudha Pada of that Bhava. With reference to this Arudha
Pada of the concerned Bbava. we have to judge the G1:lspic10Us or inauspicious nature of that Bhava, its decrease or
"as increase. Thus we have to determine eight Arudha padas

When the arudha lagna is a benefic sign with a benefic

in it. the native enjoys all pleasures and good fortune.
Benefics in the konas and kendras of Arudha lagna will

make the native a king and a great scholar. Malefics in the
Arudha lagna and in its konas and kendras will give the
contrary results; and the same effects will appear when
malefics are in houses 6,8 and 12 from Arudha lagna. In
this way the benefic and malefic nature of the results
should be predicted for all the eight arudhas.
Notes

In chart 88 the Arudha lagna is Vrishchika and
Shukra occupies it. The sign is owned by the natural
malefic but functional benefic Kuja, Guru is in a kona,
Shani in a kendra and Kuja and Rahu are in the twelfth.
The health of the native will be indifferent; and because of
Kuja and Rahu in 12 he underwent some operations. The
arudha of the tenth (Rajya Pada) is Kumbha. The kendras
have Shani and Shukra, while a kona has Kuja and Rahu.
Guiu and Budha are in upachayas. The native succeeded
in his professional career, but after a struggle. In this way
we have to judge the other Arudhas. For instance, the
Arudha of the seventh is Mina. Kuja and Rahu are in the
eighth indicating the loss of wife. But as the lord of DaraPada is exalted, a second marriage is bound to be there.

If we want to know about the children of the native. we
have to take the help of the arudhas of houses 2, 5 and 9.
We have to examine carefully these Bhavas, Jupiter and the
lord of lagna. Also the Arudhas of these Bhavas from Guru
and from the lord of the lagna have to be examined along
with the upapadas from these two and the benefic conjunctions and aspects. If any malefic conjunction or aspect is

106

not there. there will be many children. The larger number
of planets in odd and even signs will enable us to infer the
number of sons and daughters.

Note the following combinations:
(l) Budha, Shani and Kuja in the arudha Padas of
houses 2. 5. 9 and 12 from lagna, from the lord of

(ll) Budha, Shani and Kuja in conjunction with the lord

(ill) Budha, Shant and Kuja posited in the Rasi and Amsa
of the Bhava;

Shant and Guru in conjunction in one of these
Bhavas.

In all these cases there will be loss of children or still
Lbirths.
If the tenth house and its lord are with or aspected by
Shant, there will be an adopted son. The wise have declared
these various ways.

If in the fourth from Arudha lagna there are Chandra
and Shukra or if that house is aspected by Chandra and

Shukra, the native has many great mansions. When this
fourth house has an exalted planet, the same results will
appear; but he will suffer from leucoderma and leprosy.
Thus the results have to be judged from a consideration of
the sign, its navamsa and its dvadasamsa, and also from
the planets having advanced or less advanced degrees in
any sign. 01)' these lines one should judge the profession
and manliness of the native.

Notes
In the decreasing order of degrees Jaimini speaks of
Atma, Amatya, Bhratri, Matri, Putra, Jnati and Dara karakas. One having the lowest number of degrees is Darakaraka. For details about these see our translation of and
notes on Jalmlnl Sutras, first chapter (Ranjan Publications).
Jaimini's Amatya karaka (one having the next highest
degree position to the Atmakaraka) is stated by the present
author to determine the native's profession. The one next
lower to Amatya Karaka will determine the native's valour
and manliness.
Thus in chart 83 Jaimini's Karakas are: Atma - Budha,
Amatya - Shukra, Bhratri - Guru, Matri . Chandra, Putra
- Shant, Jnati - Ravi, and Dara . Kuja. The lagnas of these
in Jaimini are respectively Dhanus, Mina, Makara,
Mithuna, Kanya, Mina and Vrischika. As per the present
author these are Dhanush, Vrischika, Karka, Makara,
Stmha, Makara, and Tula. Yet he seems to count the houses
from the sign occupied by the Atmakaraka in Rasi only.

Notes

These are the karakatvas or factors signified by the
twelve houses starting from the lagna. These have to be
correlated with planets that signify them. Thus the ninth
house refers to the father and so does the Sun. The two
have to be taken together. The fifth house and Guru refer
to Children. The second house and Guru indicate money.
In this way one has to proceed. Hence the author gives a list
of factors Signified by the different luminaries (Ravi and
Chandra), shadowy planets (Rahu and Ketu), and the remaining five planets.

Planets appear under one of the nine auasthas, states.
These are:
(l) Dtpta - blazing. when the planet is exalted.
(ii) Stimita - stable, when it is in its own house.
(iii) Mudita - delighted, when it is in the house of an
adhimitra (highly friendly sign).
(iv) Shanta - Calm. quiescent, when it is in the house of
a friendly planet.
(v) Hina - deficient. when it is in the house of.a neutral
planet.
(vi) DUkk~ - sorrowful or dejected, when it is in the
house of an enemy.
(vll) Vikala - vexatious, when it is conjunct with a .malefic.
(viii) Khala - base or wicked. when it is defeated in the
planetary war.
(ix) Kopa - angry. when it is With the Sun, that is, when
it is combust.

Notes

The natural relationships of a planet with others get
modified by temporary relationships. Then we get Adhimitra (very friendly), mitra (friendly), sarna (neutral), shatru
Ilnin.tcal) and Adhi Shatru (highly inimical). Here the author has ignored the last one.
Being with the Sun means combustion. The orb of
combustion differs from planet to planet. The degrees given
below have to be counted forwards and backwards as well.
These are the degrees from the Sun. Within these degrees
the planet is combust. These are:
Moon 12. Kuja 17. Budha 14 and when retrograde only
12, Or.ru II, Shukra 10 and when retrograde only 8, and
Shani 15.

The results of the virtuous or sinful actions of the ...
previous life have to be gone through in this life. These are
'revealed by the planets and their major and minor periods
on the basis of the horoscope of a person. Hence it is
necessary to know the duration of the major periods of the
planets, and the minor periods in each major period. Then]
one can undertake the necessary remedial or propitiatory
activities to overcome any malefic results and to acquire the
desired happiness.

The major periods of the planets follow the sequence
of the Sun, Moon, Kuja, Rahu , Guru, Shant, Budha, Ketu
and Shukra. The number of years for the major periods of

Uttara Kalamrita

140

the planets are respectively 6, 10,7. 18. 16. 19. 17.7 and
20 years. The order or sequence is given above. The major
period that operates at the time of birth has to be found out.
Count from Krittika to the constellation of the Moon at the
time of birth. Expunge multiples of nine. The remainder is
to be counted from the Sun onwards.
Notes

Total number of years is 120. Hence it is called Vimshottari and at times it is termed Udu Dasa. Udu means
nakshatra, constellation.
The method given by the author can be illustrated in
this way. A person was born when the Moon was in Sravana. Counting from Krittika and including Sravana, we get
twenty. Dividing by nine we have two as the remainder. The
second one from the Sun is the Moon. Hence at the time of
birth the native was going through the major period of
Moon.

Note the total duration of the nakshatra in which a
person is born. Find how many Ghatikas and Vighatikas
are yet to pass after the time of birth. Divide this by the total
duration in Ghatikas and Vighatikas. Multiply the product
by the number of years allotted to the planet governing that
nakshatra. This gives the number of years still to be experienced by the native in that Dasa. The remainder is to be
converted into months and days.

Notes
An illustration will make this clear. A person was born
at Bombay on the twelfth of October 1989 at 11.30 A.M. The
local mean time of Sun rise at Bombay on that day was 5.57
A.M. The time elapsed by the time of birth from Sun rise was
five hours and 33 minutes. Multiplying this by 21/2 we get
13 ghatikas and 521/2 Vighatikas. The total is 8321/2
Vighatikas.

The Panchanga gives the ghattkas and Vighatikas from
Sunrise-the ending positions. On the 12th of October
Satabhisha was upto 19 ghatikas and 46 Vighatikas. The
unexpired portion is five ghatikas and 531/2 Vighatikas or
3531/2 Vighatikas.
On the eleventh of October 1989 Dhanishtha ended at
24 Gh. 23 Vgh, Then Satabhisha started. Day and night
together make up sixty ghattkas. Thus on the previous day
Satabhisha was for 35 ghatikas and 37 Vighatikas. On the
12th of October Satabhisha was upto 19 Gh. 46 Vighatikas.
Adding the two we get 55 Ghatikas and 23 Vtghatikas. This
works to 3323 Vtghattkas.
Satabhisha refers to Rahu whose Dasa is for eighteen
years. Then we have:
1
353- x 18 + 3323
2

6363
=

3323

This gives one year, ten months, and 29 days as the
portion of Rahu's major period yet to be gone through from
the date of birth.

Uttara Kalamrlta

142

Now-a-days we have the Ephemeris. They generally
give the positions of the luminaries and planets on every
day at 5.30 A.M. Now Lahtri's Ephemeris places the Moon
on the twelfth at 5.30 A.M. in Kumbha at 14°.53'.18". On
the thirteenth at 5.30 A.M. the Moon is in Kumbha at
29°.36'.18". During these twenty four hours the Moon has
traversed 14°.43'. The birth being at 11.30 A.M. the time is
six hours after 5.30 A.M. During this time the Moon covers
3°.40'.45". Adding this to 14°.53'.18" we get Kumbha
18°.34'.3". From Mesha it is 19114 minutes and three
seconds.
Each nakshatra covers 800 minutes, and each quarter
of a nakshatra is for 200 minutes. Dividing 19114'.3" by
200 we get 955 quarters and 114'.3". Dividing 19114'.3" by
800 we find that twenty three constellations are over, and
in the 24th 714'.3" are over. The 24th is Satabhisha from
Asvini. It gives Rahu mahadasa at birth. From the duration
of 800' for a constellation deduct 714'.3". We get 85'.57" or
5157 seconds. Multiply this by eighteen, the years of Rahu.
The product is 92826". Eight hundred minutes of a nakshatra give 48000 seconds. Since we have converted. the remainder into seconds, divide it by 48000. We get one year,
eleven months and six days as the balance of Rahu rnahadasa at the time of birth. This is the correct balance as
compared with that derived from the Panchanga. There is
only a difference of seven days.

The method for obtaining the duration of an antar
dasa is explained now. Note the number of years allotted to
a planet whose major dasa is running. Multiply it by the
number of years given to a planet whose sub-period is

Results of the Major Periods of Planets

143

required. Multiply the number in the place of the units
by three. The result is the number of days. The numbers
in tens and hundreds give the months of the antardasa.
Thus we get the durations of each sub-period in a major
period.
Convert the duration of the antardasa in days. Multiply it by the number of years given to the planet concerned.
Divide the product by 120. The result is the duration of the
sub-sub period (Vidasa) of the planet in the antardasa of
another. The remainder is to be converted into ghattkas and
Vighatikas.
Still a sub-period of this sub-sub-period can be obtained. This is the sukshma Dasa of a planet. The numbers
arrived at will be the duration of the sukshma dasa in days,
ghatikas and Vighatikas.
Notes
Take Rahu dasa which has 18 years. The first period
Will be that of Rahu, and the last that of Kuja, We require
the sub-period ofShani who has 19 years. Multiply the two.
The product is 342. The figure in units multiplie9 by three
gives the number of days. The sub-period of Shani in Rahu
is thus for 34 months and six days. The first Vidasa in the
antardasa of Shant is that of Shani and the last is that of
Guru. Now we want vidasa of Shani in Shant's antardasa.
By converting the sub-period of Shani into days we get
1026 days. Multiply it by Shant's years (19) because we
want the Vidasa of Shani. The product is 19494. Dividing
this by 120 we get 162 days. The remainder is 54. This is
to be converted into ghatikas. Multiply this by 60 and divide
it by 120. We get 27 ghatikas. The Vidasa of Shani in the
antardasa of Shani during the major period of Rahu is for
five months, twelve days and 27 ghatikas.
Similarly for Sukshma Dasa, multiply the vidasa period by the years of the lord of the sukshma dasa, and divide
it by 120. Thus for Budha's Sukshma Dasa in Shant's
Vidasha we get 162 days 27 ghatikas X 17,..) 120 = 23 days
and 191/2 Vighatikas.

When the Sun is highly beneficial in a chart, _durmg
his major period he gives sons, intellig,ence, wisdom, power
or authority, knowledge, access .to wealth, fame, powers,
happiness and the favour of God. If the Sun is a malefic to
the native or is malefically situated, the native has great
suffering, and his efforts become fruitless. One has then
loss of money along with ill-health, worries and troubles
from foes, displeasure of the ruler. danger to the father and
other similar things.

When Ravi and Shani are in their own signs or in their
exaltation signs, or in their navamsa signs, and if they are
in the konas and kendras or if they own such konas and
kendras, they confer royal favours, wealth and happiness in
the Sun's sub period of Saturn's major period. In Shani's
sub period during the Sun's major period the native has
happiness, wealth and success. But if the two are maleftcs,
they cause losses to the native.

In the same manner if Kuja and Guru arc strong and
are posited in favourable houses and if they arc with or
aspected by benefics, they cause Raja yoga. They give
pleasure, all kinds of luxuries, happiness, surviving good
sons, marriages and other auspicious functions. Otherwise
they will give the very opposite results.

Kuja has always shown in our experience that one of these
two is a malefic and the oth~r'a benefic. At the very fag end
of his period Guru gave him a daughter who remained
unwed. The author's views cannot be accepted. As
Shudraka said in his famous play Mrichchha-Katlka. Kuja
appears to be the enemy of Guru. The exaltation of Guru is
Kuja's debilitation sign. while Guru's debilitation sign is his
house of exaltation. Further research is needed on this
point.

Note the exact position of the Moon at the time of the
Sun's return to the position at the time of birth. Find how
many more ghatikas and Vighattkas are yet to elapse in that
constellation. This is to be multiplied by the number of days
given to the planet and divided by the total duration of the
constellation, This gives the balance of the first dasa in
clays, Ghatikas, and Vighattkas. Then follow the other
dasas in the sequence given below. These daysarrdrthetr
order arc given thus-Sun 110, Moon 60, Kuja 32, Budha
40, Guru 48, Shukra 56, Shani 4, Rahu 5, and Lagna 10.
The subsequent dasas follow this sequence only. The
benefic or malefic results of any dasa are to be interpreted
with reference to the strength of the planet concerned, the
strength of the lagna for the year, the strength of the Bhava
havtng the planet, and the various aspects on the planets
and houses.
Notes

The author has propounded a simpler method than
that of the Tajaka authorities like Nilakantha. The Tajaka
system requires the calculation of the strength of five
Vargas, and of the twelve vargas. Then of the planets and
lagna, that which has the lowest position rules the first
dasa in that order. Here the method is simplified.
We illustrate with reference to a chart given earlier.
Here we take only the nirayana (sidereal) position of the

days. Out of 800 minutes for each star, the Moon has to
traverse 488 minutes because Pushyami ends at 16°.40'.
The balance of Guru's period at the beginning of the year
is 29 days. In the Sapta varga strength the planets and

Lagna 2.375, Rahu 1.875, Kuja 2.25, Budha 1.92,

Shant .594.

Kuja

Guru

Guru and Shani are the weakest ones. The periods of
Guru, Shukra and Shant were over on April 21. Rahu and
Lagna periods were completed by May 6. Chandra in the
ninth sign, but in the eighth bhava, had his period from
August 24 to October 23. This was a period of ill health in
the family. Shani as lord of 3 and 4 is with Shukra, lord of
7 and 12. Shukra's period ended on April 17 and he created
quarrels and misunderstandings with his brothers. Kuja in
the fifth Bhava has to give benefic results (from October 23
to November 24) and he did not.
This method is simpler than the Tajaka one. Dr.
Raman and Mr. Lahiri have given tables for the annual solar
return. These tables are not to be accepted blindly. They
have to be verified by calculating the exact time when the
Sun returns to the natal position. The day of return coincides with the date of the Christian calender. Lahiri's tables
give the solar return for 1989 at H 3.38.9 A.M. Actual
calculation gives H 3.49.44 A.M.

164

Uttara Kalamrita

Dr. B.V. Raman has given a table on page 247 of his
Hindu Predictive Astrology (Edn, 1986) and stated that he
corrected it in his book Varshaphal. The 1982 editionofthe

second book gives for the completion of 69 years the time
of solar return as 3.38.9 A.M. on January 22, 1989. This is
not correct as per the calculations made by us.
Mr. V.S. Sastri in his edition of Uttara Kalamrtta
( 1951), page 200 gives a table. The native whose example
we have taken was born at gh. 10.57. This table gives the
solar return as H. 2.51.19 A.M. (I.S.T.). There is an error of
nearly 58 minutes. This is just to show that the tables given
are not to be trusted. One should calculate for a given time.
There is also a problem. Should we calculate the lagna
and other bhavas, for the latitude of the place of birth or for
the place where a person happens to be on that day. Mr.
Bradley prefers the latter. We hold to the place of birth. But
it is open for an extensive research.
Annual solar return is also known as Chalit Kundali,
or Varshaphala, or as the Hindu Progressed horoscope. All
these, literally understood, are misleading terms.
The error in calculations based on the tables given is
due to an error in the duration of the solar year. Modern
astronomers give the duration of the sidereal (nirayana)
year as 365.256363 days, and of the tropical (sayana) year
as 365.242193 days. The duration of the solar year as per
the Surya Siddhanta is greater by 3.245 minutes. This has
,given rise to the errors in the tables for the annual solar
return.
The duration of the dasas given by the author is better
~and simpler than the one given by the Tajaka writers. Even
though some argue that the Tajaka system originated in
India, the names of the yogas given therein and other
factors prevalent in that system compel us to the belief that
the Tajaka was an Arabic system, probably outlined by
Indian authorities known as Yavanesvara (actually
Sphujidhvaja) and others. It is partly based also on the
teachings of Ptolemy and Monetho (Manlttha), The present

While tnterpretmg the solar return chart we have also
to pay attention to the transits of the planets during that
year. The counting is from the sign occupied by the Moon
at the time of birth. By blending the solar return chart with
the transits (Gochara) one should make the predictions.
Now we explain in a very easy manner the results of the
dasas during the year.
Notes
Gochara or transits are generally reckoned from lagna
till one is 33 years old. For the next 33 years the count is
r'rom the- Moon sign at birth. The last one-third is from the
sljii occupied by the Sun at birth. Some argue that the
ri5CkdIliilg is from the radical Moon sign or lagna, whichever
is

stronger.

It is not enough to consider Gochara effects from the
radicaTMoon-sign. GOChara has a dfrect reference to Ashtakavaria. without reductions. The bindus in the original
Ashtakavarga can and do riiOdify the results of Gochara
positions.

indicating the object of the question are benefic, whether
they are in benefic houses, and whether they mutually

20). The orb of the aspect is not beyond twelve degrees.
Then the astrologer can predict the fulfilment of the object
on the basis of the strength. benefic nature and the like
referred to above, of the two planets. Proper attention
should be paid to the nature of the aspect as explained in
Chapter 4 and verse 33. The strength of the signttlcator
should also be considered. Then alone one should give the
prediction.
If there is any planet between the two lords referred to
above. and if it has an applying aspect within twelve degrees with either of the two, one may predict on the basis
of that planet the nature. functions, and the like ascribed
to the planet in the fifth Chapter. The time when the matter
will be accomplished is to be made on the basis ofSloka 18
,~f this Chapter.
Notes

The author has briefly explained how one can determine the results of the question asked. Here he refers to the
applying aspect. A planet at three degrees of a sign aspecting another on eleven degrees has an applying aspect.
If the aspecting planet is on twenty degrees it has a sepa-

rating aspect.
The lord of the lagna and the lord of the action must
have an applying aspect. This is from the houses 1. 3. 4. 5,
7 and 10 from their positions. Then there is the successful
result. If there is a separating aspect, the good results may
not follow. The orb of the aspect is twelve degrees. If the
range is zero, the result has taken place at the time of
question. If it is within twelve degrees. the result comes
quickly. If it is beyond twelve degrees. the result may take
a long time.
If there is a planet between the two and has an applying aspect. the result comes easily. but through a middleman. The nature of this planet indicates the caste, colour.
and age of the person who helps.

Kuja at 3°.25' of Tula aspects the Sun in Makara on
8°.10'. The Chandra on 19°.44' is conjunct the Sun. The
aspect of Mars on the Moon comes via the Sun. Such
aspects also are to be taken into consideration.
For horary astrology one has to go into greater details.
These can be had from works like the Prasna Tantra and
Prasna Marga. All these have to be studied carefully before
answering queries. The present author has indicated only
a few guidelines.

There are some special predictions to be made for a
child born when the Moon is in Aslesha or Magha. Each
constellation has four quarters (Padas, charanas). For the
four quarters of Aslesha the results are respectively (i)
destruction of wealth, (ti) loss of brother, (tit) death of the
mother, and (tv) death of the father. Ifone is born at the very
end of Aslesha, the child may die. To prevent this danger
one should propitiate Rudra, Kala. Antaka and Mrityu.
If the birth is when the Moon is in Magha, the results
are opposite to those given for Aslesha.
Notes

This is too sweeping a statement. There are many born
in Aslesha, and yet the adverse results did not appear.
We give the method accepted by the authorities on
Dharma Shastra. Divide the total duration of Aslesha into
5. 7, 2. 3, 4, 8, 11, 6, 9 and 5 ghatikas. when its total
duration is sixty ghatikas. Each ghatika equals 24 minutes.
When its duration is more or less than 60 ghattkas, calculate accordingly. These ten parts in the sequence give
kingdom, loss of father, loss of mother, sex enjoyment,
devotion to father. strength, cruelty. renunciation. enjoyment and wealth. The first quarter of Aslesha is good. The
second quarter gives loss of wealth. The third is bad for the
mother, and the fourth for the father. The last quarter is bad
for the father-in law. The first quarter of Magha is bad for
the new-born.

The effects are the same if one is born when the Moon
is in -Jyeshtha, Mula. Revati and Asvini. The last degrees of
Aslesha, Jyeshtha and Revati, and the first degrees of
Magha, Mula and Asvini are called gandanta (critical)
nakshatras. They provide vulnerable points and they can
bring about the death of the child. If the child happens to

survive it will be a great emperor or ruler and have unequalled valour.

Notell
Revati and Asvini, Aslesha and Magha, Jyeshtha and
Mula are gandanta nakshatras. They appear at the critical
junctures of two stgns each.
The duration ofJyeshtha is to be divided into ten equal
parts. These parts denote respectively deaths of the maternal grandmother, the maternal grandfather, the maternal
uncle, mother, itself, collaterals <gotra-ja), the families of
both parents, elder brother or sister, father in law, and
everything.
A boy born in Jyeshtha destroys his elder brother and
a girl her husband's elder brother. The last quarter destroys
the child and its father. These readings have to be modified
and carefully considered. They are intended to compel the
parents to perform Shanti.
The first quarter of Mula is dangerous to the father, the
second to the mother, the third to the wealth, and the
fourth to the family. Some wise men have ascribed no defect
to the fourth quarter.
The ghatikas before and after Mula started is called
Abhukta Mula. This is highly dangerous.
The first quarter of Asvini and the last quarter of Revati
are dangerous.
Asvini, Magha and Mula are the starting points of
three signs. Aslesha, Jyeshtha and Revati are closing
points of three signs. Thus these six stars represent
nakshatrantarala and also Rasi antarala. Hence the birth in
these constellations requires the performance of major
Shantis.

A girl having first menses in these gandanta stars soon
becomes a widow and she has no children, wealth, happiness and good clothes. She becomes sinful and is a destroyer of the father's family. To avert these results and to
make her happy, prosperous and the mother of children,
.one should perform Japa, Homa and sacrifice to the planets
(Graha makha) and worship Gods and Brahmanas.

If a girl's birth or her first menses take place in the.
prohibited time (tyajyakala) of four Ghatika , the results \
will be the death of the father, death of the mother, loss of
money, or one's own destruction. These four refer to the
first, second, third and fourth Ghatikas respectively of the
tyajyakala. To avert these dangers the worship of Rudra, )'
Yama, Agni and Mrityu respectively is necessary. If the
birth or first menses takes place during a solar or a lunar

Tyajyakala is the time to be

A precious and divinely efficacious medicine should be
prepared or taken when the Moon is in the amrtta ghatikas
of a star. Then it acts like the nectar of the Gods and cures
the ailment of the native. It removes completely all ailments
arising from the three humours. It brings back perfect
health, makes the organs firm and strong. and assures a
long life. The founder of the medical science was the sage
Dhanvantart, born of the milky ocean. He has explained in
many ways the medical treatments to be followed for removing the various diseases.

Notes
There are Mrityu Bhagas and Amrita Bhagas in each
sign for the Moon. The degrees of mrityu in the various
signs from Mesha onwards are 26. 12. 13, 25, 24, 11, 26,
14. 13. 25, 5 and 12.
.
The auspicious degrees likewise are 21. 14, 18,8, 19,
9, 24, 11, 23, 14, 19 and 9.
The three humours mentioned in Ayurveda are Vata
(wind), Pitta (bile) and Kapha (Phlegm).
The following table gives the beginning of the
vtshaghaukas. Amrita Ghatikas and Mrityu Bhagas of the
several nakshatras. The first two have a duration of four
Ghatikas.

If a person has no son even after he completed sixty
years of age, or if his horoscope indicates a short life and
he finds that he has no child so far, he must try to get an
adopted son in the year desired by him. The boy chosen
must have a long life, children, prosperity, fame and good
intellect. This adoption ceremony should be in the forenoon
of an auspicious day in uttarayana.

Uttarayana starts from the Sun's entry into Makara

Between to-be-adopted and the adopting father the
different kutas should agree. The boy should belong to his
own gotra. At the time chosen the Moon should be in
Asvini, Rohini, Punarvasu, Pushyami, Uttara Phalgunt,
Hasta, Sva ti, Anuradha, Uttara Ashadha, Sravana,
Dhantshtha, Satabhisha, Uttara Bhadra, or Revati. No
malefic should be in Lagna and the fifth house. Moon's
placement and the nakshatra on that day should be in
harmony with the natal ones. Benefics should be in lagna
or aspect it.
Notes

The author has suddenly brought in the kutas. They
are considered generally for forging a marriage alliance, The
kutas take into consideration the nakshatras ofthe boy and
the girl. Their application here is irrelevant.
There are twenty kutas. Of these eleven are important.
These are Dina. gana, yorn, Rajju, Vedha, Nadi, Mahendra,
Strtdtrgha, Rast, Rasyadhipati, and Vasya. Of these 3, 4, 6,
8 and 11 refer to the girl also, and the counting is done from
the girl's star. Hence their application in the case of an
adoption is meaningless.

At the moment of erecting a pole or a bamboo for the

day). Multiply this by five. To this product add the number
ofthe nakshatra counted from krittika. To this product add
twelve and divide the total by nine. When the remainder is
I, 4 or 7 the king of the tortoise will be in water. The result
is beneficial. If the remainder is 2, 5 or 8 the tortoise is on
the land and the result is loss or destruction. If the remainder is 3, 6 or 9 the tortoise is in the sky and the effect is
death.
Notes

The author is confusing Kurma Chakra which is to be
satisfactory only for entering a new house. EVidently this
chapter was included by some one else.

When you are constructing a new building, note three
indicators in the vertical forms. In each one draw four
horizontal lines. Begin from the bottom on the left side and
note the stars from Asvini onwards. The nakshatra rising
then and the three on the top give good results. But a
malefic posited on the rising side suggests death. If it is a
benefic, the result is beneficial.

When one enters a new house or a new town, or when
he is to undertake a new thing, count from the star occupied by the Sun to the star in which the Moon is located at
that time. In this counting include Abhijit. It is after Uttara
Ashadha and before Sravana. If the star is within the first
seven ones (counted from the Sun), it portends evil. There
are good results if it is within the next four. In the next
three, the result is bad. If it is within the next 14, the result

Miscellaneous Problems in Prediction

Is good.. This is the Vrishabha Chakra.
If the star is within the first five from the star occupied by the Sun, the result is bad. Within the next eight,
the effect is good. In the next eight it is bad, and in the
last six it is good. This is the kalasa chakra. The good. or
bad effects of any undertaking can be predicted in this
manner.
Notes
The Vrishabha and Kalasa chakras are dealt with in
the (Purva) Kalamrlta. And when the author deals with the
same, we have to conclude that the author was not the
writer of the (Purva) Kalamrita.
In Vrishabha Chakra we include Abhijit, and in Kalasa
Chakra we exclude it. The count is from the star in which
the Sun is posited to the star in which the Moon is on the
required day. In Vrishabha Chakra the stars 8 to II, 15 to
18 and 23 to 28 are auspicious. In Kalasa Chakra the stars
6 to 9, 10 to 13 and 22 to 27 are auspicious. The two must
coincide.

The sukkani is the wheel on whose directions and

Arabic and it came into vogue in Indian languages after the
seventh century A.D. The author now describes the moment for this.
Count from the star occupied by the Sun on that day
to the one occupied by the Moon. Abhijit is included. The
first six are above the foot, next three are on the top of the
prop, then three are on the bottom. Then have one on the
back, six on both sides (three each), three on the helm of
the ship, and last six inside the boat. This diagram has to
be used at the time of building a new boat, or of launching
it. The six over the boat and the six inside are proportions.

Shraddha is a rite performed on the lunar day every
year of the original demise. This rite can be parvana or
Ekoddishta. The ceremony of offering Ptndas to the greatgrand-father, grand father, and father, and to mother, her
mother-in-law, and to the mother-in-law of this mother-inlaw. is called Parvana. The one done to the father or mother
alone is Ekoddishta. This has three forms-Nitya or daily,
naimittika or conditional as in Mahalaya fortnight (dark
fortnight of Bhadrapada) ann kamya or optional or depending on the desire or intention. The Vriddhi Shraddha is
performed when a son is born. The tarpanas to the dead arc
given on every new moon day. and on the Makara and
Karkataka ingresses (Sankrantil of the Sun.

Between the twins the elder one is determined by the

Trijyeshtha (Three .Iyeshthas) is to be avoided, the
marriage of the eldest son or daughter in the lunar month
of Jyeshtha, the child born when the Moon is in the constellation of Jyeshtha and the eldest son or daughter form

that of his adopted father. At the time of marriage he must
adopt both the Gotras. It is not proper for him to have a
marriage alliance with his mother's family. His own mother
and his maternal grandfather are on a par with each other.
Notes

The author has entered into a dangerous ground only
to betray his ignorance. When a person is given in adoption,
the mantras chanted refer to his death at one place and to
his birth at another. He loses the right to perform the
Shraddhas of his original parents. Rather. he violates
dharma if he performs the Shraddhas for them.
The author states that there should be no marriage
alliance with the maternal side. Is it allowed for persons
who do not go in for adoption? This he rejected earlier. The
statement here shows his confused mind.

Even when the Nandikarma is performed, one should
not proceed with upanayana if there is a fall of meteors, and
showers of fire, or if the mother of the boy enters then into
her menstrual course. If these events take place after the
initial ceremonial meal of the Brahmacharins, the upanayana should not be stopped. The same principle applies to
the marriage of the daughter. The father by himself should
not give his daughter in marriage. When the mother is dead,
the father can perform the upanayana, if he is free from any
pollution.
Notes

Nandi Shraddha is a rite performed on the day of
Upanayana, but before the Upanayana. Upanayana is the
investiture of the sacred thread and initiation into Gayatri.
Five Brahamacharis who had Upanayana and who are not
married are fed in Nandi Shraddha. The father can give his

After the Nandi Shraddha, the Brahmachari should
eat only in the company of his mother. Likewise the bridegroom should eat always along with his wife after marriage.
The bridegroom should have his hair cut as per the custom
in his family. The sacred fire kindled in Upanayana is
inferior to the Grihya fire. When the ordinary fire is mixed
with the sacred fire, it should be worshipped with the
mantra beginning with 'Paht' (protect me). It should be
worshipped thus only by the learned, not by those who
have no relationship with the boy.
Notes

The first sentence is vague and is contrary to the
observed customs. The mother has to sit with the father
when the initiation into Gayatri is given. This is not allowed
after a meal. The author's confused mind gives rise to this
objection. The bridegroom and the bride have to eat side by
side on the day of marriage only. On other days she may eat
later.

Notes

Child marriages came into vogue only after the Muslim
invasions. Social and political factors were responsible forthis. In the Vedic times a fully grown woman was bent on
choosing her own husband. The latter authors interpolated
verses into the Smritis to give sanction to child marriages.
A girl, according to the Vedic instances, should get married
only after her menstrual periods begin.

The Grihya Sutras state that the upakarma (annual
renewal of the sacred thread for the householders) for the
boy who had his Upanayana earlier in the year, should be
performed in the lunar month Sravana. But it should not
be performed on that day if there is a solar ingress into a
new sign. or if Guru or Shukra or both are combust. Those
following Yajur Veda perform it only on the full Moon day
of Shravana month. Those who follow Rig Veda observe it
on a day when the Moon is in Sravana constellation. The
followers of Sarna Veda observe it when the Moon is in
Hasta.
Now we describe the eighth lunar day of the dark half
of Sravana month which is the birth day of Lord Srikrishna.

Lord Srikrishna was born on the eighth day of the dark

sacred. But the tithi should extend upto mid-night and it
should not be vitiated by the previous tithi.

When this Janmashtami tithi extends beyond three

to Maha Shivaratri.
The fourtl;llunar day in the bright half of the Bhadrapada month is auspicious for the worship of Lord Ganesha.
If the tithi touches the next tithi and if the constellation is
Chitra, it is highly praiseworthy. It is not 80 if the third tithi

touchee-It.

Rishi Panchami is very powerful if it is connected with
the previous fourth lunar day of the bright half of Bhadrapada, not with the sixth lunar day.
When the fourteenth lunar day of the bright half of
Bhadrapada extends upto noon, Lord Ananta should be
worshipped on that day.
The fourteenth day in the dark fortnight of Asvina

religious merit for anyone who takes an oil bath on that day
at the time of the rising of the Moon.

A bath in the early morning on the fourth day of the
bright half of the month Magha is delightful to Adisesha,
the Lord of the serpents. Likewise a bath on the Ratha
Saptami day (seventh lunar day of Magha Shukla Paksha) .
is very pleasing to the Sun, if there is also the constellation
of Anuradha.
It is also meritorious like taking a bath on the occasions of a crore of solar eclipses, or like the bath when the
twelve sun rise together at the same time.
The sacred Shivaratri extending upto midnight in the
dark half of Magha will reward a person with a union with
Lord Shiva.
Notes

By no stretch of imagination or astronomical manipulations can we have the constellation of Anuradha on the
Ratha Saptami day. The constellation will be near about
Asvini only. The author has lost touch with the elements of
astronomy.
Maha Shiva Ratri falls on the day when the fourteenth
tithi in the dark half Magha month extends at least upto
midnight on that day.

In the dark fortnight of the lunar month of Magha the
fourteenth tithi is called Shiva-tithi, a day sacred to Lord
Shiva. It is also called Maha Shiva Ratri. This fourteenth
day in the dark half of every lunar month is also sacred to
Lord Shiva. Hence one should devoutly worship on this day
Lord Shiva alongwtth the Divine Mother at dusk (pradosha). This gives glorious results.
Likewise on every day there is a period of three
muhurtas as soon as the Sun touches the peak of the
setting hill. At this time he should be worshipped.

On the Shivaratri day a period of two Ghatikas (48
minutes) at midnight is called l\(aha-Nisha or the great
night.
Notes

Does a muhurta cover 24 minutes? Actually a 48
minute period is called muhurtaka. In reality a muhurta is
only a period of three minutes. It is a time of seven and a

A Shraddha should not be performed on the day of a
solar eclipse. But on the day of a lunar eclipse; it can be
performed, because the eclipse of the Moon and its attendant rites take place at night while the Shraddha is performed in the day-time.

must follow the convention accepted by the majority.

In the case of Shraddha, there is no ashaucha once the

Likewise in a sacrifice when a Brahmana is sprinkled
with the sanctified water for initiation, he is not affected by
ashaucha. The actual sacrifice, however, begins later with
the chanting of the Vedic mantras.

The sacred texts (Shrutl) declare that if there is no
solar ingress into the next sign during a lunar month, it is
called mala (soiled) or adhika (intercalary) month. Sacrificial and other rites related to the Manes (dead ancestors)
are forbidden in that month. The daily and ordained duties .
alone should be performed in that month by the wise or
discriminating ones, Only the monthly Sraddha can be
performed in this month. In the case of this intercalary
month. the month has sixty days. The annual Shraddhas,
sacrifices and similar rites concerning the gods are not to
be performed.

Notes

It is the custom to perform the annual Shraddha in the
Intercalary month and also in the next one.

Ten Ghatikas before and after the solar ingress into
',Mesha are auspicious, in Vrishabha it is 16 Ghatikas
before, in Mithuna 16 after that, in Karkataka 30 ghattkas
before the ingress; in Simha 16 before, in Kanya 16 after;
in Tula 10 before and after; in Vrischika 16 before; in
Dhanush 16 after; in Makara 40 after; in Kumbha 16
before; and in Mina 16 after.

Notes
This is arbitrary. For Uttarayana (solar ingress into
Makara) the auspicious time extends to twenty Ghatikas
after the ingress. In the case of Dakshinayana (solar ingress
into karkataka), the auspicious time begins at twenty
Ghatikas before the ingress and ends with the ingress. This
is the view of the Dharma Shastras of Madhava, Nirnaya
Sindhu and others.

The libations of water for the dead (tarpanas) should
not be dropped on the bare ground or into an iron or bronze
vessel. Join the thumb to the index finger and the covered
space below these closed fingers or between these two
fingers is a sign of inviting the dead ancestors. With the
other finger one should offer rice or food on the ground with
deep devotion. The same rule operates in the case of the
offering to Chitrao This is made while one begins to eat. This
should not at all be eaten.

Notcs
Chitra is the name for a small quantity of cooked rice
taken from the plate and placed on the ground near the
plate. It is offered to the ants, birds and the like later on.

There are five vital airs called Prana, Apana, Vyana,
Udana, and Samana. These are within the body,
When the time of the marriage is in the fore-noon, the
bride and bridegroom along with the parents of the girl have
to fast till sthalipaka is completed on that night. Fasting in

How should sthalipaka be done? Divide the duration of the
night by thirty. Omit the last two parts. Just before the last
two parts. in the 28th part the sthalipaka homa should be
performed. if it is not an amavasya (new moon night, the
30th tithi). If the day is an amavasya and if the woman has
no child. the Darsa homa should be gone through and also
on the day of the solar ingress.

No one in his senses can fix the day of the marriage of
his daughter or son on the day he has to perform a
Shraddha.

When the wife is pregnant the tonsure ceremony
(chaula) of his son should not be performed, and he should
not have a hair-cut. He should not during the period of
pregnancy eres:t pillars. lay the foundations, or construct a
house. The pregnant woman should not take a bath in the
sea and she should not go on a long journey. When a child
is born on the amavasya of Bhadrapada (Mahalaya or
Pitrimoksha amavasya), or at the time of the death of a
family member, or on the first day of the lunar month or on
the twelfth day of the dark fortnight, one should go through
his daily vaisvadeva as per the rules laid down by the
experts in the four forms of knowledge.

Now the author describes tarpana (offering water with
the seeds of sesamum to the dead). Offering tarpanas to the
dead is important on every amavasya (dark moon day). and

236

Uttara Kalamrtta

on Mahalaya (last day of the lunar Bhadrapada). These are
given in order of importance. Then the tarpana should be
given on the day of death, the day of Shraddha. If the
Sapindikarana has been done, then the tarpana on
amavasya and the one on Mahalaya amavasya should be
done in the first year itself.
When one Visits the holy waters or shrines the following should be avoided by the Wise: (1) offering holy water,
(2) rule regarding the fingers while eating, (3) difference in
the branches (Shakhas) of the Veda, (4) the question about
satisfying the dead ancestors, (5) the scattering of the
particles of food for the unknown or un-cared for dead ones,
(6) invoking the souls of the dead, and (7) offering oblations
into the Shraddha fire. The same rule holds good in the case
of the sankalpa Shraddha too.

Just as one performs Shraddha for his father, he
should do the same for the wives of the father as well. He
should do similarly for his own dead wives, elder brothers,
paternal uncles and maternal grand father. Oblations are to
be made in the aupasanagni (the marital fire), and those of
the Shraddha In.the ordinary fire. Even the son of a co-wife
has the right to perform the Shraddha of a wife belonging
to another caste. But the husband should not do it.

The cleaning process given in the previous verse is for
a house-holder. It is doubled for a brahmachari (unmarried
celibant). It is thrice for a Vanaprastha, the third ashrama
when the person retires to a forest. It is four times for the
asetic. Only by a holy bath the woman should wash away
the ointment, sandal paste and the like. Shudras and those
that observe some view like the brahmacharins, urchins,
uneducated or ignorant rusties should follow the same
procedure. The body should not be given away into the
waters after death. There are crores of tirthas (holy rivers).

Note.
The author forgets that an ascetic can have jalasamadhi, giving up his body in a floWing river or lake. The
great spiritual giant and avadhuta His holiness Chandra

After taking food. and after urination, excretion
and falling of sperm, one should gurgle water one
hundred and eight times to wash his mouth. In the
solar months of Mtthuna, Karkataka, and Simha all
the rivers are in their menstrual courses. Hence it is
not proper to bathe in these rivers during these
months (roughly from the fifteenth of June to the sixteenth
of September every year). But if one has such a bath. he
should get purified by a bath at the confluence of the river
and the sea.
Notes

The months referred to come in the rainy season when
the rivers swell. It is also believed that a husband and his
wife should not bathe together in the Narmada.

The original text does not give this division of a Chapter. But the first 76 verses ofthis kanda have no astrological
significance. What pertains to astrology begins now. Hence
we have made this into a new Chapter.
Draw the figure of Goddess Sarasvati under the sacred
Aum (~). Draw ten vertical lines and over them ten horizontal lines. The squares formed by even columns and similar
rows (omitting four squares in the centre) are twelve. They
represent the twelve signs of the Zodiac counted from
Mesha. We will now describe the function of the twelve
Bhavas (houses) from lagna onwards so that the wise can
ascertain their significance.

Notes
The Zodical figure is given below. The corner on the left
is Mina (Pisces). The signs follow the clockwise direction.

The benefics owning the konas (1.5.9) are beneficial
if they occupy the kendras or houses 2. 3 or 11. But a
benefic owning a kendra will not give good results. On the
other hand. a malefic owning a kendra is not inauspicious.
If the lords of the eighth and the twelfth from lagna are in
conjunction. or if they have exchanged houses. they produce different results. The eighth lord gives good result and
the twelfth lord gives wealth. luck and the like.

and Shukra owning kendras are not beneficial. If they are
posited in maraka houses (second or seventh from lagna),
they put an end to the life during their major periods. If
Budha is posited in the same way, he gives similar results.
If the Sun or the Moon own the eighth house, they will not
prove marakas (stgntflcators of death). When Kuja owns the
fourth and the ninth houses (for those born in Simha
lagna), or if he owns the fifth and the tenth houses (for
those born in Karkataka lagna), he is very auspicious. But
he is not so if he owns only one of the two houses. This
applies to those born in Dhanush. Makara, and Kumbha

Notes

Shani, Shukra and Kuja are benefic for those born in
Kumbha, Tula, and Mesha lagnas respectively even if they
own malefic eighth and twelfth houses. Mars is a benefic for
Mesha lagna and Shukra for a Tula lagna. Mars is a malefic
for Vrischika lagna and Shukra for Vrishabha lagna.

If Rahu or Ketu and the lords of a kona 0, 5, 9), are
together in the ninth or tenth, or if one of them is in the
ninth and the other in the tenth or vice versa, there is
prosperity to the native. A conjunction of either with the
lord of a kona will be beneficial. In these circumstances the
major periods ofthe nodes and of those with them will bring
happiness. If there is a malefic planet associated in the

If the lord of the ninth owns the eighth or the twelfth
also, or if the lords of the ninth and the tenth are with the

For those born in Mesha lagna Budha is a malefic. Sun

Shukra is a maraka. Shant and others may be malefics; but
they do not kill.

Notes
Guru and Shani as lords of 9 and 10 prove auspicious
only in 9 or 10. Ravi is the lord of a Kona. Budha as lord
of 3 and 6 is a malefic. Shukra owns
maraka houses.
Some authorities hold that Shukra for Mesha lagna, and
Kuja for Tula lagna are not marakas.

Shani can do good for Vrishabha lagna. Even if Guru

For those born in Mithuna lagna Ravi, Kuja and Guru

For those born in Karkataka lagna Budha and Shukra
are malefics. Kuja and Guru are benefics.

kendra. As regards karkataka lagna, we cannot accept the

for Vrishabha lagna is not a benefic as he owns the sixth as

Kuja is a yoga karaka for Karka lagna as he owns a
kendra (0) and kana (5). Other than the Sun the rest can
cause death. These are the effects for those born in Karkataka lagna.
'
For Simha lagna Budha and Shukra are benefics. Kuja
and Guru are yoga Karakas. The conjunction of Guru and
Shukra is not beneficial. Budha and others can bring about
death.
Kuja, Guru and Chandra are malefics for Kanya lagna.
Shukra is the only benefic.
Notes

For Karkataka and Simha lagna Kuja is a yoga Karaka
as he owns a Kendra and a kana. Budha is a malefic for
Karkataka as he owns houses 3 and 12. For Simha lagna
Shukra owning a Kendra becomes a functional malefic.
Guru owning his mulatrikona as the fifth house is a benefic.
For Kanya lagna Kuja owns 3 and 8, while Guru owns
two kendras. These two are malefics. It is debatable
whether the Moon becomes a malefic.

Here is a modification. Chandra and Shukra are yoga
karakas for Kanya lagna, It is better that they are together.

Second Kanda

Shukra alone is a maraka, and not the others.
For Tula lagna Guru (lord of 3 and 6), Ravi (lord of 11)
and Kuja (lord of 2 and 7, maraka house) are malefics. The
Moon (lord of 10) with Budha (lord of 9) causes Raja yoga.
Kuja is a maraka. Ravi and Guru do not cause death. Shani
and Budha are benefics.
Notes

Other standard texts state that Shukra for Mesha
lagna and Kuja for Tula lagna are not marakas.
Shant is a yoga karaka as he owns a kendra and a
kona. Having his mulatrtkona in the twelfth, Budha cannot
be considered as a full benefic. Guru is a malefic. But in the
fourth or in the tenth he has given excellent results.

For Vrischika lagna Kuja (lord of I and 6), Budha (lord
of 8 and 11), and Shukra (lord of 7 and 12) give Inausptcious results. The Moon is the only benefic. Rav:tand
Chandra give very good results when they are together or
separate. Guru by himself is not a maraka. If Budha and
others behave like marakas, they can cause death.
For Dhanush Lagna Shukra alone is a malefic. Ravi
and Kuja are great benefics.
Notes

For Vrischika lagna the mulatrikona of Kuja falls in
the sixth. and hence he is a malefic. In spite of the author,
the conjunction of Ravi and Chandra is not at all favourable
as it takes place around the new Moon (amavasya). Budha
as lord of the eighth is found to be giving good results.
For the lagna of Dhanush Kuja's mulatrtkona and
Ravi's are in 5 and 9. They are great benefics. But Kuja

Uttara Kalamrita

must be ahead of Ravi.

For those born in Dhanur lagna, the combination of
Ravi and Budha causes Raja yoga (lords of 9 and 10). But
Budha is a maraka, and not Shukra and others.
For Makara lagna Chandra, Kuja and Guru are malefics. Budha and Shukra are beneflcs. By himself Shani will
not kill. Kuja and others can kill. The best yoga karaka is
Shukra.

Notes
For Dhanush Budha owns two Kendras. If he is not
with malefics, he becomes a malefic. With Ravt he is a
benefic.
For Makara lagna Shukra's mulatrtkona falls in a
kendra. Does he not become a malefic?
Budha is a benefic as his mulatrikona is a kana house.
Experience shows that Guru gives good results for
Makara lagna, Shani is not a maraka as he owns the lagna,
But in lagna he can cause death.

For those born in Kumbha lagna Chandra (lord of 6),
Kuja (lord of 3 and 10) and Guru are malefics. Shukra is a

benefic yoga. Guru is not a maraka. Ravi, Kuja and others

conjunction cause Raja yoga. Kuja is not a maraka. But
Budha is a maraka. If Shani and others prove Marakas,
they cause death.
Notes

How can Kuja be a malefic for Kumbha? He owns an
upachaya and a kendra, The author contradicts himself
when he speaks of a yoga for the conjunction of Kuja with
Budha (lords of a kendra and a kona).
Shukra is a first rate malefic for Mina lagna as he owns
houses 3 and 8. Shanfs mulatrikona falls in the twelfth.
Mars as the lord of 9 and Moon as the lord of the fifth are
beneflcs, inspite of the author.
If Budha is a benefic for Simha lagna, Guru can as well
be a benefic for Kumbha lagna.

These are the results for those born in Mina lagna.
The benefic or malefic results of any planet are to be
interpreted in the light of the nature of the concerned
planet, its position, its ownership, and its association with
others.
The benefic planets give the native wife and children,
happiness to the father. profits and other benefits in their
periods. These are related to the Bhavas they own and they
occupy. The results will appear in their sub-periods of other
planets as well.

prehending astrology ask whether anyone has understood
this subject. The answer is in the negative. If there is any,
he is the only one and he keeps it to himself. Even asses,
dogs and the like are born under similar yogas, and they
also get the results of such yogas in the Dasas of th~__
concerned planets. But these yogas are also subject' to
other forces or influences.

When any malefic is exalted along with being a maraka
the evil it can do need not be described. Shani gives very
good wealth and prosperity if he is in lagna and if the lagna
is Tula, Dhanush or Mina. If in this situation the seventh
house is not occupied or aspected by Guru or Budha, the
native becomes a king. Yet one can predict death in the
major or sub-period of the lord of the seventh house.

When Shukra is in iagna and Guru in the seventh, or
. when Guru is in the eighth from the lord of the eighth and
\ is in the twelfth from a malefic, the native has a life of only
thirty years. When Shani is in the eighth from the lord of
the ninth and is in an odd Navamsa, the native does not
have continuous prosperity. If he is similarly posited
with respect to the lord of the fourth, the native loses his
vehicles.

When the Moon is conjoined with Shukra, and the lord
of that house is in a Kendra or Kona, the native will have
good vehicles throughout his life and he has prosperity.
·If the lord of the eighth house counted from the third
that is, the lord of the tenth from lagna)is in houses 1, 3.
6, 7 or II one should expect loss of brothers. If the eighth
house has a debilitated planet and Guru neither aspects it
nor is in that house, the native's death is early.

When the lord of the eighth house from the ninth (it is
the lord of the fourth from lagna) is aspected by the Moon,
the native has a short life. If Shukra and Rahu are there. the
prosperity of fortune of the native will start declining from
Ketu's major period.
If Shukra is in the sixth or in the eighth and is with
Ulka and similar meteors, the longevity of the native is
considerably reduced. This can take place when a planet
owning a movable sign gets into that from a dual sign on
its transit.
Notea

Ulka is an extremely dangerous comet. It is at the fifth
or the tenth constellation from that in which the Sun is
posited.
In Brthat Samhlta (33.8) Varahamihira thus describes
the Ulka: "It is broad at the top and has a small tail. As it
falls down. its dimensions increase. It has a length of three
and a half cubits. There are several varieties of it".
